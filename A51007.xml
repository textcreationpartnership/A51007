            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>THE only Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that engag'd me to Publiſh this Work, was my Deſire to pleaſe You, and to ſecure that Intereſt in Your Goodneſs, with which You are pleas'd to Honour me. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my Reſolution was a little ſhock'd, when I reflected on the Dangers and Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to which an Author ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes himſelf, by appearing in ſo Nice and Knowing an Age: But my Reluctancy was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:45740:4"/>
overcome by the ſenſe I had of my Obligation to give You this Mark of my Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment and Reſpect.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>His Grace</hi> the DUKE of <hi>ORMOND, Your Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> did me the Honour to commit the Care of Your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation to me, I labour'd with all the Application I was capable of, to diſcharge that great Truſt with ſuitable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and Fidelity: And, to ſpeak only of Your <hi>Travels,</hi> I may ſay without Vanity, that I was very careful to make You receive all that Pleaſure and Advantage You might deſire or expect from 'em. My preſent Attempt is but a Continuation of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Care: My chief Deſign in the Publication of theſe
<pb facs="tcp:45740:4"/>
Letters being to refreſh and preſerve the <hi>Idea's</hi> of what You then obſerv'd, and to make that Satisfaction laſting, which, perhaps, Time would have inſenſibly deſtroy'd.</p>
                  <p>I hope, SIR, You will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive favourably this Effect of my Zeal and Affection to Your Service. If You were as <hi>ſevere</hi> a <hi>Critick,</hi> as You are an <hi>exact Judge,</hi> I might juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſpair of pleaſing You: But all my Fears vaniſh when I reflect on that peculiar Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Temper, and that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inclination You have to conſider Things on the moſt Advantageous ſide. This Thought inſpires me with ſo much Confidence, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than Your <hi>Modeſty,</hi> could over-awe me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
<pb facs="tcp:45740:5"/>
the Impetuoſity of my Deſires. I would give You all the Praiſes You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and think my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to take this Occaſion to proclaim the Generoſity, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity, Courage, Moderation, and all the other Vertues which I have ſo often admir'd in You, if I were not ſenſible that I could not do You Juſtice without offending You.</p>
                  <p>And therefore all that I ſhall ſay on ſo alluring a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is, That thoſe admirable Perfections are a part of Your Heritage, as being inſeparably united to the Illuſtrious Blood that fills Your Veins. True Nobility, and Greatneſs of Mind have been always entail'd on Your Family. The Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of His Grace the late
<pb facs="tcp:45740:5"/>
DUKE of <hi>ORMOND</hi> is ſpread over all <hi>Europe,</hi> in the moſt Glorious manner imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. And the EARL of <hi>OSSORY,</hi> Your Father, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd himſelf with equal Care and Succeſs to the Imitation of ſo Noble a Pattern: That Great Captain was at once the Terror of His Prince's Enemies, the Joy and Love of the People, the Delight of the Court, and Admiration of Strangers. The Honour which I had in Your Company, to approach ſeveral <hi>Sovereign Princes,</hi> gave me the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to learn from their own Mouths, how highly they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd him, and with how ſenſible an Affliction they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the News of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Period of ſo bright a Life. <hi>His Grace</hi> the DUKE
<pb facs="tcp:45740:6"/>
of <hi>ORMOND Your Brother,</hi> is, with <hi>You,</hi> SIR, the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Succeſſor of thoſe <hi>Hero's.</hi> You are both unwearied Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers of Glory, and You loſe no Opportunity to ſignalize Your Valour and Conduct. I offer up the moſt ardent Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for Your Common Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and I entreat You to believe that I ſhall always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with an unalterable Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and profound Reſpect,</p>

                  <head>THE AUTHOR's PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>WHEN I undertook the Voyage deſcrib'd in the following Letters, I reſolv'd to keep an exact Journal of the moſt remarkable Things that ſhould fall under my Obſervation; and ſome of my Friends having engag'd me to communicate my Remarks to 'em, from time to time, my intended Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal was inſenſibly chang'd to Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p>I will not trouble the Reader with an Account of the Reaſons that oblige me to ſuffer this little Work to appear in Publick: But, perhaps, it will not be improper to inform him,
<pb facs="tcp:45740:7"/>
why I thought fit to ſend it abroad in its Native Dreſs. The Style of the Letters is Conciſe, Free, and Familiar, and in all reſpects moſt ſuitable to my Deſign. When an Author under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to give a particular Deſcription of the Subject on which he writes, he is oblig'd to acquaint his Reader with all its Circumſtances, and to omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that relates to it. But there is a very wide difference between an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Deſcription of a Country, and a brief Account of it in a Letter.</p>
                  <p>So that if it be Objected, that I have forgot to mention ſeveral things that deſerv'd to be taken notice of, I ſhall content my ſelf with making this ſhort Reply, that, He who Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes nothing, cannot be juſtly accus'd of Forgetting any thing. Theſe are familiar Letters, in which I do not in the leaſt oblige my ſelf to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert all that might be ſaid of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces mention'd in 'em: Only I relate
<pb facs="tcp:45740:7"/>
what I have ſeen, or heard, from Perſons of unqueſtion'd Credit; and what, in my Opinion, deſerves to be communicated to the Publick.</p>
                  <p>If it be further pretended, that I treat of ſome things which were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known before; I anſwer, That if all thoſe who repeat the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others muſt be condemn'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mercy, by the ſame Sentence moſt Books that are extant, muſt be doom'd to the Fire: For the new Diſcoveries of a whole Age would ſcarce fill a ſmall Volume. Every Man has a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent way of expreſſing his Thoughts, and of repreſenting the Subjects of which he treats; which makes 'em in a manner different from themſelves, when deſcrib'd by another, and gives a right to each particular Perſon to make new Reflections on 'em. But not to inſiſt on that Plea; The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of theſe Letters will find an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thoſe Things that happen'd
<pb facs="tcp:45740:8"/>
in my Time, and of ſome late Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which I cannot be ſuppos'd to have borrow'd from thoſe who wrote before me: And, in the general, I ſee no reaſon why the Book, which I now offer to the Publick, may not juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly claim the Title of a <hi>New Work,</hi> and I'm confident, it will be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as ſuch, by all unprejudic'd Perſons, who ſhall conſider either that I have added ſeveral remarkable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, or eſtabliſh'd <hi>Idea's</hi> that I found to be juſter, and more exact than thoſe I had receiv'd from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of others; or, to add no other Conſiderations, that I have given a new Turn of Expreſſion to ſuch things as were already deſcrib'd. And tho' I could not wholly omit ſome Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages that had been formerly taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by other Authors, without ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Connexion of the Parts of my Work, and depriving the future Traveller of part of the Advantage
<pb facs="tcp:45740:8"/>
which I hope he may receive from my Labours; yet, upon a careful Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, it will be found that many of my Obſervations are in all reſpects New and Uncommon.</p>
                  <p>I could not leave the Places thro' which I paſt on the Road, without examining and enquiring into the moſt remarkable Things that were to be found in 'em, and without giving ſome account of 'em in my Letters. But ſince the main Deſign of our Voyage was to ſee <hi>Italy;</hi> and ſince I have chiefly inſiſted on the Deſcription of that Countrey, I thought fit to give that Title to the whole Work, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees properly to the principal part of it.</p>
                  <p>Of thoſe who travel into <hi>Italy,</hi> ſome make it their only buſineſs to enquire after its Antiquities; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers apply themſelves wholly to the ſtudy of Painting and Architecture: There are ſome who mind nothing but
<pb facs="tcp:45740:9"/>
Libraries, and Cabinets of Curioſities; and others ſpend their time in viſiting Churches and Relicks. But my Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity was more Univerſal, and would not ſuffer me to confine my Enquiries to one Subject; which gives my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the advantage of Variety, and at leaſt in this reſpect, I hope they will not ſeem unpleaſant to the generality of Readers.</p>
                  <p>When I found my ſelf under an almoſt indiſpenſable neceſſity to conſent to the Publication of this Work, I thought my ſelf oblig'd to make it uſeful to thoſe who ſhall afterwards undertake the ſame Voyage: And therefore I have inſerted ſeveral Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in thoſe Letters, which I did not think fit to mention, when they were only directed to two or three Friends: And, in purſuance of the ſame Deſign, I have ſubjoin'd an <hi>Appendix</hi> at the end of the Book, containing Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or Inſtructions to a Traveller.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:45740:9"/>To ſatisfie the importunate deſires of thoſe with whom I entertain'd a Correſpondence during my Travels, I was forc'd to give 'em an account of every thing I obſerv'd, without omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting even the ſmalleſt and leaſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Remarks. But ſince the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of moſt Readers extends not ſo far, I was ſoon perſuaded to obey thoſe who advis'd me to cut off ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Paſſages in my Letters, which perhaps would have been eſteem'd Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent or Trifling. For thoſe who have the Happineſs to be Maſters of an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Wit, and of an equally ſolid and nice Judgment, are capable of making Advantage of every thing, and are uſually ſooner pleas'd than thoſe who are leſs beholding to Nature for the liberal Diſtribution of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. If it be ſtill urg'd, that I have left ſeveral Paſſages which might have been cut off with the reſt, I muſt beg leave to tell thoſe pretended
<pb facs="tcp:45740:10"/>
Criticks, that They are very much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken if they imagine that nothing ought to be admitted into Works of this Nature, but what is great and important. Theſe are neither Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, nor Negotiations of Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors; and that which might be juſtly call'd a Trifle in a Diſcourſe upon a lofty Subject, deſerves another Title in ſuch a Relation as this, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a Letter. Beſides, there are ſome mean and ſeemingly trifling Things, which, for all their meanneſs, are yet very pleaſant and diverting. The Publick has receiv'd ſome Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions very favourably, which take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the ſmalleſt Circumſtances, not forgetting even the Signs of Taverns; neither indeed is it juſt to oblige a Traveller to relate nothing but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies. 'Tis true, he ought not to fill his Journal with inſipid Obſervations; but there is hardly any thing on which an exact and ingenious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb facs="tcp:45740:10"/>
is not capable of making Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions.</p>
                  <p>I have obſerv'd, that thoſe who ſpeak of <hi>Italy</hi> are uſually full of Prejudices, which are extremely to the Advantage of that Country. Moſt Young Travellers being perſuaded that they ſhall find there an infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſurprizing Rarities, go thither with a Reſolution to admire every thing they ſee. And all the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we have of it, ſeem to have been deſign'd for Panegyricks. The Fame of that part of the World has been rais'd ſo high, and ſo ſtrongly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd, that 'tis eſteem'd an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable Crime to leſſen its Reputation. The Grandeur, for Example, and the almoſt infinite Magnificence of the celebrated City of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the ancient Charms of <hi>Bayae</hi> and <hi>Capua,</hi> inſpire the generality of Mankind with a Veneration for a few pieces of Marble, which are the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
<pb facs="tcp:45740:11"/>
of their Ruines; tho' 'tis certain that thoſe Places, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider 'em in their preſent Condition, are not at all preferrable to a vaſt Number of others, which are not ſo much as taken notice of in the World. But there is alſo another Reaſon, which doubtleſs contributes very much to confirm Travellers in their Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices; and that is, the uſual manner in which the <hi>Italians</hi> ſpeak of their Country. 'Tis certain, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that Nation have ſo much Fire in their Imagination, and their Phraſes are naturally ſo ſtrong and ſignificative, that they are oftentimes apt to ſpeak of Things with too much Force. 'Tis true, they have many ſoft and pleaſant, not to ſay Apiſh and Childiſh Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but when they change their Style, they are apt to run to the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity, and, on a ſudden, loſe themſelves in wild and unnatural Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perboles. This Humour of the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:45740:11"/>
by degrees infects ſome of thoſe Strangers who reſide among 'em, and in conjunction with their former Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, prompts 'em to make long and lofty Diſcourſes, on the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Subjects. The Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe Miſcarriages in others, made me very careful to avoid falling into the ſame Errors: I examin'd things coolly, and ſuffer'd thoſe perpetual Admirers to evaporate in ſublime Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and Exclamations of Wonder, without regarding their pompous and ſuperlative Expreſſions. But tho' I had not the Complaiſance to admire every thing which they extoll'd, I hope I ſhall not have the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be accus'd of being poſſeſs'd with a Prejudice, oppoſite to that which I blame in others; for the equitable Reader will eaſily perceive, that I take Pleaſure to do juſtice to thoſe things which I think de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Praiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:45740:12"/>I wrote theſe Letters without conſulting the Authors who have treated of the ſame Subject before me: For beſides that the hurry of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling made ſuch a Deſign impra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable, I could not have receiv'd much benefit by it, ſince, as I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated before, I intended only to relate what I ſaw, or learn'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out engaging in a particular and exact Deſcription of the Country. I thought fit to make this ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Declaration, That if any Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in this Work be found to be inconſiſtent with the Relations of others, I may not be accus'd of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Pleaſure to contradict 'em; for I only give a ſincere and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Account of my own Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, or of what I heard from Perſons of unſuſpected Credit, without the leaſt Deſign to offend any Man whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:45740:12"/>I hope every candid Reader will make a Diſtinction between thoſe things which I affirm poſitively, and thoſe which are uſher'd in with a <hi>'Tis ſaid;</hi> tho' even in theſe Caſes I have related nothing but what is grounded on the general Opinion, and was never contradicted by any with whom I have had occaſion to converſe: For, after all, I would not be oblig'd to warrant the Truth of theſe common Reports, which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes found to be common Lyes.</p>
                  <p>To avoid the Confuſion occaſion'd by the various length of Leagues and Miles in <hi>Germany;</hi> I uſually expreſs the diſtance of Places by the Number of Hours that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſpent in travelling between 'em; and if at any time I make uſe of the Word <hi>League,</hi> I underſtand an Hour's Journey. The <hi>Italian</hi> Miles are generally known, and need no explication; only the Reader may take
<pb facs="tcp:45740:13"/>
notice, That Two Miles in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> make almoſt Three, after the ordinary way of reckoning; and that the Miles of <hi>Lombardy</hi> are the ſhorteſt of all. I ſhall only add, That when I meaſure any Diſtance by a certain number of Paces, I mean the Steps I uſually make in Walking,</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>
                        <hi>HOLLAND</hi> is a Country ſo near and ſo well known to yours, that I ſhould, perhaps, have ſaid nothing of it, had not your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Commands obliged me to it; in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance therefore with your deſires, I will endeavour to give you an Idea of this rare Country, with a particular Account of the Cities I ſaw there. As to the reſt, <hi>Holland</hi> hath ſo many particulars worth your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and View, that I think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible you ſhould decline making a Voyage thither: The Paſſage over is but ſhort, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45740:15"/>
you will have a thouſand opportunities to render it convenient. But being perſuaded, that you will not fail, one day, to ſatisfie ſo reaſonable a Curioſity, I ſhall not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you ſo largely as I might, with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thoſe charming Provinces, wherein I have formerly, for a long time, ſojourned.</p>
                     <p>We obſerved, from our Veſſel, as we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd theſe Coaſts, that the nearer we came, we perceived the tops of the Trees, and the ſummits of the Steeples, as if they iſſued out of a Land ſunk under Water. In ſhort, <hi>Holland</hi> is univerſally flat and low, like one continued Meadow. 'Tis cut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Canals, and large Ditches, to receive and drain the Waters, which otherwiſe would ſoak the Lands like drunken Toſts; there are but few Places that can be Cultivated. A Country like this is not naturally Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; yet, Induſtry, conſtant Labour, and the Love of Profit, have brought it into ſuch a State, that there is not in the World, one ſo Rich, and ſo well Peopled, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to its extent<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Pufendorf.</hi> Others pretend that the Seven Provinces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether do not contain more than Two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. It is difficult for a private Perſon to learn the certainty of thoſe kind of things. See <hi>Voſſius.</hi>
                        </note>: Some do not ſtick to averr, that this little Province alone, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes more than Two Millions and Five Hundred Thouſand Souls.</p>
                     <p>The Cities are as it were<note n="†" place="margin">The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces have one City of the firſt Rank, <hi>viz. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam.</hi> Above twenty of the ſecond Rank, which may compare with the great Cities of <hi>France,</hi> after <hi>Paris.</hi> More than Thirty of the third, which equal <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Modena.</hi> Above two hundred great Towns, and more than eight hundred Villages. <hi>G. L.</hi>
                        </note> link'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and we may ſay that they are all of a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45740:15"/>
ſparkling Beauty. The more we conſider them, the more agreeable we find them.<note n="*" place="margin">There is no leſs curioſity and neatneſs in their Ships than in their Houſes. This Cleanlineſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: You may find it in the Stables, where the Cows Tales are tied up with a little Cord to the Roof, leaſt they ſhould defile themſelves. They waſh all, and ſcowre all the Walls, Moveables, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſils of Houſhold-ſtuff.</note> Great care is taken to keep their Houſes neat and fine, both within and without, they Waſh them, and Paint the very Bricks over, from time to time; ſo that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways look new. The Doors and the Croſs-bars are commonly reveſted with hewn Stone or Marble; the inſide of the Shops, and lower Rooms, even with the common Tradeſmen, are alſo commonly lined with ſquare Tiles. The Glaſs-Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows all ſhine like Chryſtal; every Window hath its Shutters, which are commonly painted red or green, and make altogether a mixture moſt pleaſant to the ſight.</p>
                     <p>The Streets are ſo clean, that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men walk abroad in Slippers all the Year. The Canals every where are adorned with two rows of Trees, which make a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Shade, and a delicate Walk on each ſide the Streets. You have here almoſt a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Idea not only of the Cities, but alſo of the Towns and Villages, for the ſame Order and Neatneſs is to be ſeen throughout.</p>
                     <p>The moſt uſual way of Travelling, is by the Canals, and nothing is ſo convenient. The Boats are drawn by Horſes, and they go off at ſet hours. You are therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently ſeated, againſt Storms of Rain or Wind: So that you change the Country, without knowing almoſt that you are out of the Houſe. When the Canals are Frozen, the Skates and the Sledges — are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Boats; and this new way of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45740:16"/>
Travelling is a ſecond Pleaſure. Thoſe who ſlide skilfully on Skates will out-run the Poſt-Horſes, ſome will undertake to go a League in ten Minutes. Thus you ſee how commodious their Canals are, but this is not all the convenience they receive, by the drain of their Waters; they are alſo uſeful for Traffick, and tranſport of Goods as well as Men. The Earth which they take out, raiſes the Banks, and makes the ways more fit for Foot-Men; they ſerve both for Encloſure and Ornament. In ſome Places they have plenty of Fiſh.</p>
                     <p>Abundance of things are naturally want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Holland:</hi> But Foreign Countries plentifully ſupply them with Corn, as well as Wines and all other Neceſſaries for Life. All the World knows how far their Trade extends: And it may well be ſaid, that as it in part gave the original Strength to the State, ſo it is ſtill its principal or only ſupport. Every Man in <hi>Holland</hi> is a kind of Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious Creature, equally accuſtomed both to Sea and Land. I remember I have read it in a good Author: That this ſole Province hath more<note n="†" place="margin">The number of Veſſels in the common Opinion is eſteemed ſo great, that it is thought to equal all the reſt of <hi>Europe</hi> together. <hi>Card. Bentivoglio. Pufendorf</hi> ſaith the ſame, and others bave writ that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces have as many Ships as Houſes. I cannot think any Perſon hath exactly Calculated them, every one ſpeaks as he imagines, or hath heard, ſo that little heed is to be given to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of this nature.</note> Shipping than all the reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true, that if on one ſide the Sea is the cauſe of all the Riches of <hi>Holland,</hi> it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45740:16"/>
muſt alſo be confeſſed, that it hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cauſed terrible Damages. It is ſtopped with Banks of Earth, which we call Dams, and all care imaginable is taken to maintain them. They have Mills to empty the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and uſe all imaginable Induſtry to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Miſchief, or to remedy it when it hath happened. Yet ſome places of theſe Banks are often broken, and the rolling of the Waves makes moſt furious Ravages. So that as to the<note n="*" place="margin">On the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>April, 1420.</hi> one hundred thouſand People were drowned at <hi>Dort,</hi> or thereabouts. There were fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Pariſhes drowned. <hi>Seb. Munſter.</hi> The Sea carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away <hi>121</hi> Houſes of the Villages of <hi>Scheveling,</hi> and <hi>1574. (S. Parival)</hi> at this day the Church is near the Sea, whereas formerly it was in the midſt of the Village.</note> Sea, they may well uſe the Device of a Torch Reverſed. <hi>That which feeds me kills me.</hi> This, <hi>Sir,</hi> is the fatal Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of <hi>Holland,</hi> a ſtrange inconveniency, of which all that can be ſaid is, That they labour to help it as much as they can; but can never reſtore the drowned Cities, nor the lives of many Millions of Men who have, from time to time, periſhed by theſe Deluges.</p>
                     <p>It is not without ſome regret that I diſturb your former and more pleaſing Idea's; but I fanſie that to apprehend things well, we muſt know both what's for, and what's againſt them. Nor is this the only defect. For the Air is no where very good. Sometimes in the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Weather it ſuddenly becomes Cold, and this inequality admits of no great difference between the Summer and Winter
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45740:17"/>
Cloaths.<note n="†" place="margin">The Gabel of Salt is the leaſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Salt coſts but two Pence or three Pence the Pound, of ſixteen Ounces. The greateſt Imports are on Wine, Beer, and Corn.</note> The Impoſitions are great, which partly cauſe the dearneſs of Victuals: But the People of this Country who are born under the Yoak, and whom their great Trade hath made live at eaſe, ſcarce think of it. I confeſs I ſhould not long admire thoſe continued Meadows of which <hi>Holland</hi> is compoſed: They ſeem very fine for a few hours, but one grows weary of their perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual uniformity. And I am perſwaded the variety of your Province of <hi>Kent,</hi> muſt be far more grateful.</p>
                     <p>We were at the ſame time ſurpris'd and charm'd at the firſt thing which we obſerv'd at our arrival at <hi>Rotterdam.</hi> This City having this ſingular Qualification, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of its Canals are broad and deep enough to receive the greateſt Veſſels, nothing can compare with <hi>the effect produced</hi> by the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary mixture of Chimnies, tops of Trees, and Streamers of Veſſels. One is aſtoniſhed at the Port to behold ſo rare a confuſion, as is that of the tops of the Houſes and Trees, and Penons of the Maſts, one cannot tell whether it be a Fleet, a City, or a Foreſt, at leaſt one ſees a thing ſeldom heard of, a Convention of thoſe three things, the Sea, the City, and the Campagne.</p>

                        <note place="margin">ROTTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAM.</note>
                        <hi>Rotterdam</hi> is not accounted as one of the Principal Cities of the Province, becauſe it hath not been always in ſuch a flouriſhing condition as we ſee it at this day; but without doubt it ought to be the ſecond of the firſt Rank, whereas now it is but the firſt of the ſecond. Its Port is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45740:17"/>
and fair, and is always fill'd and encompaſs'd with Shipping, and its Trade increaſes daily. It is very large, well Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, rich and pleaſant, and hath the neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I have repreſented; the ſituation is flat, as you are to ſuppoſe of the reſt of the Cities.</p>
                     <p>The Magazines for the equipping of Ships. The Town-houſe, aad that of the Bank, are all moſt ſtately Structures. When you come into the Glaſs-houſe, you ſee them at work on little enamell'd Bowls, and I know not how many Children's Baubles, with which they drive a great Trade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Savages. Alſo near this you have the curious Works in Paper of the Sieur <hi>Van Uliet,</hi> as Ships, Palaces, and whole Landskips in <hi>Baſſo relievo,</hi> all as they ſay done and made out with the point of a Pen-knife.</p>
                     <p>There are at preſent two <hi>French</hi> Churches at <hi>Rotterdam;</hi> which the Magiſtrates take care particularly to ſee furniſhed with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of exemplary Merit. It is certain, that this City is become famous for its Learned Men, as well as by its Trade and Beauty. It is this which beſtowed on us, <hi>the Novels of the Republick of Learning,</hi> a work ſo accepted and eſteemed: I might even ſay, a Work which is ready to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, ſince the Indiſpoſition of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor gives us reaſon to fear; he will be no more able to apply himſelf to ſo painful an undertaking; I am informed that Mr. <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage de Beauval</hi> intends the continuation.

                     <p>Being for ſome Reaſons induced to viſit a Village called <hi>Leckerkeck,</hi> three Leagues diſtant from hence, upon the River <hi>Leck,</hi> I will impart to you three or four curious things which I obſerved there.</p>
                     <p>The Lord of the Place told us, That the Salmon Fiſhing, the fifth part whereof only belongs to him, yielded him formerly twenty thouſand Francs <hi>per annum,</hi> and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more. And that the Salmon having left it by degrees, that Revenue is ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diminiſh'd, that it ſcarcely defrays the Charge of the Fiſhery in many Years, ſo that he had given it over, only lying under a neceſſity to maintain the Right. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly alſo the Salmon ſpawned before <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dretcht</hi> in ſuch multitudes that the Maid-Servants of that City, made their Bargains not to be compelled to eat it above twice
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45740:18"/>
in the Week, but at preſent they are rid of that trouble.</p>
                     <p>We went to ſee a Country Woman there, who laſt Year was brought to Bed of Six Sons, there were four of them Baptized, the Eldeſt of which lived four Months.</p>
                     <p>A Maid of the ſame Village carried a Muſquet Seven Years, without being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered what ſhe was. She went always by the name <hi>de la Bonto,</hi> which Name ſhe was Muſtered by, and at preſent ſhe is a Maid-Servant in the Houſe of the Lord of that Place.</p>
                     <p>Some Years ſince died in this place, <hi>Gueret Baſtienſe,</hi> a Fiſherman, who was eight Foot high, and weighed 500 Weight, though he was very lean. We were in his Houſe, the Doors whereof are very high, where they ſhowed us many of his Cloaths and Things.</p>
                     <p>The Poſt hour obliges me here to finiſh this Letter; be perſwaded, Sir, that I will omit nothing which I believe proper for your ſatisfaction.

The Ambaſſadors and other Miniſters of Foreign Princes have there their Reſidence. The People are more civil and ſociable than in other places. Travellers ſojourn here. The Coaches are numerous. The Houſes and Walks are very fine. The Air is perfectly good. In a word, 'tis moſt certain the <hi>Hague</hi> is an Inchanting place. The Wood is one of its chief Ornaments: For as I told you the other day, it tires one to ſee nothing but near Objects: To walk in a Wood in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> affords double refreſhment.

                     <p>The Sieur <hi>Reſner,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Zealand,</hi> who dwells at the <hi>Hague,</hi> hath a Cabinet, where, amongſt other things, you may ſee a great number of very curious Shells.</p>

                     <p>This great concourſe of Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, is the cauſe that it is always furniſhed with Maſters, requiſite for the Inſtruction of young Gentlemen in all ſorts of Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes.

                     <p>I am loath ſo ſoon to part with the <hi>Hague,</hi> which, without contradiction, is one of the moſt pleaſant Places in the World, but I muſt ſay ſomething of <hi>Leyden</hi> and <hi>Haerlem,</hi> before I finiſh my Letter.

It is a great City, but repoſe Rules there, and in it you enjoy all the ſweets of a Country Life. Its little diſturbance allows it an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Neatneſs: Nothing comes near that of its Houſes, and we may compare the Streets to ſo many Alleys of a well-adorned Garden. Yet we muſt freely confeſs, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Leyden</hi> would willingly conſent that their Pavement ſhould be leſs clean, and that they endured a little more trouble, on condition they could be Maſters of a good Haven: I have heard Projects

                     <p>In the midſt of the Hall is an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Thief, whom they derided to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, after they had Hanged him.

                     <p>I Had ſome regret to write my laſt Letter to you from <hi>Amſterdam,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">AMSTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAM.</note> without giving any account of that famous City, but that I fanſied I ſhould do well to refreſh my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory with its Idea, that I might write things more certainly. In the mean time I intreat you to remember, that I have not promiſed to give you an intire deſcription of any place: It would require a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in this City to learn every thing of it, and a great Volume to write it all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amſterdam</hi> is without doubt one of the moſt beautiful, admirable, and important Cities in the World; and 'tis certain, that it anſwers in every point the great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it hath in the World: But that one may be more Surpriſed with its Beauty, it would be beſt not to have known before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, the other Cities of <hi>Holland.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that after I had ſeen the Haven of <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and the Beauties of the <hi>Hague</hi> and <hi>Leyden,</hi> I was but little ſurpriſed when I came firſt to <hi>Amſterdam:</hi> I found nothing there which might much diſtinguiſh it from thoſe other Cities. Nay, I muſt freely tell you, that the multitude of Carts
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45740:25"/>
and Truckles,<note place="margin">There are ſome Streets which are always very clean.</note> whoſe number ſwells daily by the vaſtneſs of the Trade, ſo peſter and dirty the Streets, that it is not a very diverting Object to one who is charm'd only with ſuch things as appear pleaſant to the Eye, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if he come from another City, which can ſhew more neatneſs and tranquility.</p>
                     <p>There is no compariſon to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the greatneſs of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> ſince, according to Calculation, there are near ſeven hundred thouſand Souls in <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Amſterdam</hi> contains not above two hundred thouſand, although ſo great a number of <hi>French</hi> Refugees are lately ſettled there.

but I aſſure you that their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is not near ſo great in this City, as ſome would perſwade us. I had the fortune to diſcourſe with a very intelligent and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſon, who hath examined this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and he affirms, that the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> and the other Sectaries together, do not make a fourth part of the Inhabitants of <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> I know not whether you have heard of a kind of Convent of Nuns, call'd<note n="*" place="margin">There is <hi>130</hi> of them.

Their Church may eaſily contain <hi>2000</hi> People. <hi>Calviſius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that the Order of the <hi>Beguines</hi> was Inſtituted in the Year <hi>1207.</hi> by one called <hi>Begues.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Beguines,</hi> who are ſtill tolerated here: There are a great many of them in the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands.</hi> But becauſe I believe you are not acquainted with this ſort of Society, I will give you the Character of it in few and general terms: It is compoſed of Maidens or Widows who have no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. There are amongſt them ſome of all ſorts of Qualities, and nothing is required to make them capable of admittance but good Teſtimonials, and an Eſtate ſufficient to maintain them at their own Charges; every <hi>Beguine</hi> may have her Houſe and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conveniences by her ſelf, or they may joyn ſeveral together, according as Kindred or Friendſhip may incline them. The place of this Society bears the name of the <hi>Beguinage,</hi> which is commonly like a little City incloſed within another, and hath about it a Wall and a Ditch. There is one Church in this incloſure, where the <hi>Beguines</hi> are obliged to be preſent at the hours appointed for their Devotions. Their Habits are black, and ſomething fantaſtical. They regulate their Expences as they pleaſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45740:27"/>
themſelves, as well for their Table as Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture. They receive and pay Viſits when they pleaſe. They quit the <hi>Beguinage</hi> when they are minded to Marry, or on any other occaſion. And it may be ſaid, that this retreat, far from the vowed conſtraint of a Convent, is a very ſweet and reaſonable manner of living.</p>
                     <p>The confuſion cauſed by the Coaches, by reaſon of the perpetual Carriage of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes, and the danger of ſhaking the Houſes, which, as I told you, are founded on Piles, is the reaſon that none but Strangers and Phyſicians are allowed to have any; Sleds indeed are permitted, but that being a ſlow and uneaſie Carriage, there are none but old Women who make uſe of it.</p>
                     <p>We went to ſee a <hi>French Opera,</hi> where there was neither Machines, nor rich Cloaths, nor good Actors. That which we found moſt pleaſant was a great Laſs,<note place="margin">You ought to ſee at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> the Cabinets of Mr. <hi>Wiltzen, Vanderhem, Occo</hi> and <hi>Grill.

                     <p>It is requiſite I ſhould ſay ſomething of the famous Muſick-Houſes: They are a kind of Taverns or Halls for Dancing, where the young People, of the meaneſt ſort, Men and Maids, meet every Evening. Theſe are the meeting places, but the Intrigue is carried on in another. Uſually Strangers

                        <hi>Cologne</hi> is to be ſeen far enough off, and all in plain view in a level Country. The City is very great,<note place="margin">There are <hi>24</hi> Gates, <hi>13</hi> to the Land, and <hi>11</hi> on the <hi>Rhine.</hi>
                        </note> ſurrounded with a Wall and dry Ditch, with Towers and Baſtions which defend its Gates. There is rarely ſo great a number of Steeples to be any where ſeen, as appeared to us on the ſide we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cologne,</hi> as you know, is an Imperial City, governed by its Burgo-Maſters: But the Arch-Biſhop hath there a very great Power. This Prince takes cognizance of all Affairs both Civil and Criminal, and can Pardon thoſe whom the Magiſtrates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn.

                     <p>The Chapter of <hi>Cologne</hi> is compoſed of ſixty Canons, who ought all to be Princes or Earls. The four and twenty Eldeſt are the Capitularies.</p>
                     <p>It was formerly the Electors of <hi>Cologne,</hi> who Crowned the Emperour according to the Conſtitution of the <hi>Golden-Bull;</hi> but theſe Electors not having been Prieſts for a long time, thoſe of <hi>Mentz</hi> perform that Office in their ſtead, and the laſt have<note n="*" place="margin">They pretend alſo to this right, in quality of the firſt Arch-Biſhops.

                        <note n="†" place="margin">Thoſe who preſented the Petition were Habited all alike. They never take it ill to be called <hi>Gueux,</hi> and to diſtinguiſh themſelves by that Name, they hung a Medal at their Necks, upon which, on one ſide, was the Effigies of the King, <hi>(Philip II.)</hi> and on the other, two hands joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which held two Budgets, with divers little Porringers, and round about was written, <hi>Faithful to the King even to Beggary.</hi> Gab.

                     <p>The Town-Houſe is a great <hi>Gothick</hi> Building. We ſaw there, amongſt other things, Chambers full of Bows, Arrows, Croſs-Bows, Quivers, Bucklers, and other ancient Arms. I meaſured one of thoſe great Croſs-Bows which had need of Reſts; The Bow was of Whale-Bone, and had twelve Foot of length, eight Inches broad, and four Inches thick. It is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to behold <hi>Cologne,</hi> and the delicate Country about it, from the top of the Tower of this Houſe.</p>
                     <p>The little part of the City, which is on the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> is the Propriety of the Elector, and is the Quarter allotted to the <hi>Jews.</hi>

                     <p>The Cathedral Church remains in a very imperfect State; it is great pity ſo fine a beginning ſhould never attain its end. In the Year 1622. the three pretended Kings, who came to adore our Saviour, were brought from <hi>Milan</hi> into this Church,<note place="margin">When <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſſa</hi> cauſed <hi>Milan</hi> to be</note> where Fame attributes many Miracles to them. They ſell for a peny a dozen little Billets, which have touched them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their Virtue.</p>

                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:45740:32"/>An extraordinary Drought having cauſed a Famine in <hi>Hungary</hi> (I know not poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively in what time it was) a great number of the People of that Country, came to ſupplicate the aſſiſtance of the three Kings, after they had in vain invoked the Saints of their Country and Neighbourhood; who had no ſooner ſpoke the word, but it rained in great abundance. From that time a Proceſſion of <hi>Hungarians</hi> comes every ſeventh Year to pay Homage to their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors; and theſe People are treated and waited upon by the Magiſtrates for fifteen days, in a very fine Houſe built on purpoſe for them.</p>
                     <p>I obſerved a hole three or four Foot wide, on the top of the Vaulted Roof of the Church, and almoſt over the Chapel, where are kept theſe Royal Reliques. There are theſe words written round this Overture, <hi>Anno</hi> 1404. 30.<note place="margin">

On the</hi> 30th. <hi>of</hi> October, <hi>in the Year</hi> 1404. <hi>a great Wind blew in the Night, and drove a great Stone through the Roof.</hi> This Stone lies on the Pavement near the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Our Guide told us, they call'd it, <hi>the Devil's Stone,</hi> becauſe it is believed, the Devil threw it out of Malice to deſtroy the Chapel. I obſerv'd likewiſe in the ſame Church, over one of the doors, thirty ſix gilded Staves, about three foot long each; and this Diſtich is written underneath:
<q>
                           <l>Quot pendere vides Baculos tot Epiſcopus Annos</l>
                           <l>Huic Agrippinae praefuit Eccleſiae.</l>

And in effect, the Elector is at this time in the thirty ſeventh Year of his Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick. But I could not learn neither the Original, nor the Benefit of this Cuſtom.</p>
                     <p>We ſaw, as we paſſed, the curious Church of the Jeſuits, and from thence went to that of St. <hi>Urſula.</hi> You know, without doubt, the Legend of this Saint, and of her eleven thouſand Virgins, who were Maſſacred with her by the <hi>Huns</hi> at <hi>Cologne,</hi> in the Year 238. Thoſe who firſt wrote this Story, ſuppoſed that there was one <hi>Etherus,</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> and Husband of <hi>Urſula,</hi> and one Pope <hi>Cyriack,</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary, Perſons of whom no notice is taken in Hiſtory. In the mean time, every one of the eleven thouſand Virgins, have done eleven thouſand Miracles, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed a great number of Reliques. The Body of <hi>Urſula</hi> lay for a long time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded amongſt the reſt; but they ſay it was at laſt diſtinguiſhed by a Pigeon; who, for ſeveral days, came regularly at a ſet hour to her Tomb: And at preſent the Saint is laid near her Husband <hi>Etherus.</hi> The Church is filled with the Tombs of many of the Virgins, and you find always a multitude of Old-Women in it, repeating of <hi>Pater-noſters</hi> from Morning to Night. They ſay the Earth of this Church will not endure any other dead Corps; and to prove this, they there ſhew the Tomb of a Daughter of a certain Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> who, after they had forcibly Interred her there, raiſed up her ſelf, and remained in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45740:33"/>
the Air, ſo that they were fain to fix her with Iron, as ſhe is now two or three Feet from the Earth, againſt one of the Pillars of the Church.</p>
                     <p>It is pleaſant to ſee in a great Chapel, which is on the ſide of this ſame Church, the Bones of the Virgins, with which it is adorned and hung, after the manner which you ſee the Swords and Piſtols ranged at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> in the Guard-Chamber. Theſe Bones, except the Heads, have no Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but to the Heads they have done particular Honours; for ſome of them are put up in caſes of Silver, and others have coverings of Gold, there is none which have not at leaſt their Caps of Cloath of Gold, or a Bonnet of Crimſon-Velvet, wrought with Pearls and Jewels. Behold, Sir, what, together with the pretended three Kings, is the chief Object of the Devotion of <hi>Cologne,</hi> and from whence it comes to be called <hi>Cologne the Holy:</hi> and from hence alſo it is, that the Arms of this City are, <hi>Argent, eleven Flames Gules,</hi> with a <hi>Chief of the Second, charged with three Crowns Or.</hi> The <hi>eleven Flames</hi> are in Memorial of the eleven thouſand Virgins, and the <hi>three Crowns</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the three Kings.</p>
                     <p>In the Church of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> there is a Crucifix which wears a Peruke, which is very ſingular; but that which is marvellous and edifying is, that when the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Pilgrims come to <hi>Cologne,</hi> they do each of them cut off a lock of Hair from this Peruke, and yet it never diminiſhes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:45740:34"/>I obſerv'd, at the entrance into the Church of the Twelve Apoſtles, a Picture, which repreſents a very rare Event; which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs might eaſily be received for Truth, if the end of the Story did not render it ſuſpicious. The Wife of a Conſul of <hi>Cologne,</hi> being Buried in the Year 1571. with a Ring of great Price, the Sexton, the Night following, opened the Tomb to ſteal the Ring; I leave you to judge if he were not frighted when he felt his hand caught hold of, and when the good Lady graſped him to get out of the Sepulchre, and yet he looſed himſelf and fled away, without further Converſation. The Perſon raiſed, unwrapped her ſelf as well as ſhe could, and went to knock at the door of her Houſe; She called a Servant by his Name, and in few words told him the ſumm of her Adventure, that he might not let her Periſh with Cold: But the Man thought her a Ghoſt, and all in a fright run to tell the thing to his Maſter. (So far may be true, now comes the Fable.) The Maſter, as incredulous as the Man, called him Fool, and ſaid he would as ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Horſes were in the Garret, and inſtantly a moſt dreadful noiſe was heard in the Garret; the Man went up thither, and found ſix Coach-Horſes there, without counting the reſt in the Stable.

                        <note place="margin">EHREN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BREISTEN.</note> which ſignifies the <hi>famous Rock,</hi> or the <hi>Rock of Honour:</hi> It is built on the Ruines of the Fort of <hi>Hermeſtein,</hi> of which there remains only that corner of the Rock on which the Windmil ſtands.

                     <p>Over-againſt the Town of <hi>Caub,</hi> which belongs to the Elector Palatine, half a League from <hi>Baccharach,</hi> which appertains to him likewiſe, there is an old Caſtle called <hi>Pfaltz</hi> in the middle of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> from whence, as ſome ſay, the <hi>Pfaltzgravts,</hi> or, as we call them, the <hi>Palſgraves,</hi> or <hi>Counts Palatines,</hi> derive their Name.<note place="margin">BACCHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RACH.</note> 
                        <hi>Baccharach</hi> is a very little City built on the ſide of a Hill, and famous for its excellent Wines. One of the Miniſters of the place, with whom we Dined, pretended that <hi>Baccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach</hi> was derived from <hi>Bacchi Ara,</hi> or <hi>the Altar of Bacchus;</hi> and he told us there were four ancient Towns in the Neighbourhood, which were alſo Conſecrated to <hi>Bacchus: Steegbach,</hi> which is on a Hillock, <hi>Scala Bacchi,

                     </p>
                     <p>As we parted from <hi>Baccharach,</hi> a furious Storm aroſe, which caſt away a large Boat, and ours was not without ſome danger. We went aſhore a little before we came to <hi>Rudiſheim,</hi> where the bad Weather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained us to ſtay a while; and we paſſed by an old ruinous Houſe, which they ſaid belonged to that wicked Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mentz</hi> was made an Arch-Biſhoprick by Pope <hi>Zachary, Anno, 745.</hi>
                        </note> who was eaten by Rats. The <hi>Rhine</hi> makes there a little Iſland, in the midſt of which is a ſquare Tower, which they call the <hi>Tower of Rats:</hi> And it is commonly reported, that this Prelate, who was then the moſt wicked and cruel Man alive, fell ſick in that Houſe which I lately mentioned (ſome ſay it was in another a little further off, but that is nothing to the Story,) and that, by an extraordinary Judgment of God, he was environed with Rats, which could by no means be driven away. They add, that he cauſed himſelf to be carried into the Iſland, where he hoped he might have been freed from them, but the Rats multiplied, ſwam over the River and devoured him. An ingenious Man, whom I ſaw in this place, aſſured me, that he had read this Story in ſome old Chronicles of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. He ſaid he remembred, that the Arch-Biſhop was there nam'd <hi>Renald,</hi> and that this happened in the Tenth Age. I
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45740:36"/>
would willingly give credit to this Story, but I fear however that there is ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in it. For I know that about this time there was a certain Prieſt, named <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald,</hi> who fraudulently diſpoſſeſſed the Arch-Biſhop <hi>Henry;</hi> and that this <hi>Arnald</hi> was Maſſacred by the People, which may have given occaſion to ſome confuſion in theſe Hiſtories. Another Perſon told me, that the Name of the Arch-Biſhop was <hi>Hatton</hi> II. ſurnamed <hi>Bonoſus;</hi> and that in a time of Famine, he cauſed a great number of poor People to be aſſembled in a Barn, where he caus'd them to be burnt, ſaying, <hi>Theſe are the unprofitable Vermine, which are good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to conſume the Bread which ſhould ſerve for the Suſtenance of others.</hi> However,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pliny,</hi> upon the Teſtimony of <hi>Varro,</hi> relates that the Iſle of <hi>Gyara,</hi> one of the <hi>Cyclades,</hi> was abandoned by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants becauſe of Rats. He adds, That a City of <hi>Spain,</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by Rabbets. One in <hi>Theſſaly</hi> by Moles. One in <hi>France</hi> by Frogs. And another in <hi>Africk</hi> by Mice.</note> this Story is generally believed here, though others look upon it as a Fable. Some will lightly and haſtily ſwallow any Prodigy, and others may offend as much by too much incredulity. If the Holy Scripture deſcribes us a <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> peſtered with Lice and Frogs, and an <hi>Herod,</hi> devoured by <hi>Worms;</hi> why ſhould we haſtily condemn the like event for a Fable? More ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing things have no doubt fallen out: And I remember I have read two ſuch Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories in the <hi>Faſciculus temporum.</hi> The words of the Author are very like theſe, <hi>Mures infiniti convenerant quemdam, potenter circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallantes cum in concivio, nec potuerunt abigi donec devoraretur.</hi> That is, A multitude of Mice compaſſed him about, ſtrongly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulting him in a Banquet, nor could they

Poppielus Principes Polonorum Patruos ſuos veneno per fraudem interimit, eóſque inſepultos projicit, ſed ex cadaveribus mures enati ſunt qui Poppielum &amp; ambos ejus filios una cum uxore devorant.</hi> Chronicon de Pop. <hi>Garon</hi> places this event in the Year <hi>830.</hi> And he adds, That the Rats eat the name of <hi>Hatton,</hi> which was in many places in the Tower of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> The Hiſtory of <hi>Hatton</hi> is related at large by <hi>Trithemius</hi> in his Chronicles, and by <hi>Camerarius</hi> in his Meditations. <hi>Calviſius</hi> reports, that in <hi>1013.</hi> a certain Soldier was eaten by Rats.

                     <p>From <hi>Bonn</hi> to <hi>Binghen,</hi> three Leagues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Mentz,</hi> the <hi>Rhine</hi> is almoſt always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Mountains; this Paſſage which it ſo happily met with, ſeems to be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular work of Providence. You would fanſie it to be a Canal made on purpoſe for this River, croſs a Country which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally was inacceſſible to it, for fear, that not being capable to continue its courſe, it ſhould ſwell and overflow the Provinces, which now its Stream only waters: At the foot of the Mountains which thus ſhut it up, the whole Country is full of Vineyards; and there are to be ſeen, on its Banks, both to the right and left, a great number of little Cities and good Villages. Caſtles there are alſo very frequent, moſt of them built on aſcents, and even on the points of the ſharpeſt Rocks. I counted forty ſince my departure from <hi>Cologne.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:45740:37"/>I obſerved alſo in my way, a ſtrange fantaſticalneſs in the Habits of the Peaſants, eſpecially the Women. About <hi>Bonn</hi> and <hi>Rhindorfe</hi> they wore only on their Heads a little Cap of coloured Stuff, bordered with Galoon of another colour. Their Hair hangs in Treſſes quite down their Backs. They make their Waſte extreamly ſhort, and have a broad Leather Girdle with which they girt themſelves half a Foot below their Waſte, which is compaſſed with a thick folded Rowl, and lifts up their Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoats ſo high, that they reach but little below their Knees.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Rhine</hi> is very broad, all the way from <hi>Binghen</hi> to <hi>Mentz.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">MENTZ.</note> At <hi>Mentz</hi> you go over it on a Bridge of Boats which hath no ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters. The firſt thing you meet with, when you come to this City from <hi>Cologne,</hi> is the Elector's Palace; it is of reddiſh Stone, and its Architecture hath a great number of Ornaments, after the <hi>German,</hi> though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe regular and magnificent enough.</p>
                     <p>The bad Weather hindred us from ſeeing the Arſenal, as well as the Citadel and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fortifications. But we were aſſured our loſs was not great, there being nothing at all rare in any of them.</p>
                     <p>They told us, that in the middle of the Citadel there is a kind of Tower, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd the Tomb of <hi>Druſus. Druſus Germanicus,</hi> Brother to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> died in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> to the great Grief, as you know, of the People and Army: But he died not on the <hi>Rhine.</hi> Beſides, you may remember
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45740:38"/>
that his Body was carried to <hi>Rome</hi> to be burnt in the Field of <hi>Mars.</hi> It is true, that after <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had cauſed the Senate to give him the Surname of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> he alſo made Statues to be erected for him, with triumphal Arches, and other Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the Banks of the <hi>Rhine:</hi> And perhaps this Tower or Mauſoleum was one of his honorary Tombs, which the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>The Ornaments in which the Electors cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate Maſs are extraordinary Rich: And the Canopy under which the Hoſt is carried, on certain occaſions, is all covered with Pearls. I remember I have read in the Chronicles of the Abbey of <hi>Usberg,</hi> that they had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Treaſury of the Veſtry, an hollow Emerald of the bigneſs and ſhape of half a large Melon. This Author ſaid, that on ſome days they put Water into that Cup, with two or three little Fiſhes which ſwam about in it; and when the Cup was covered they ſhewed it to the People, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Fiſhes produced ſuch an effect, as perſuaded the ſilly People that the Stone was alive.</p>
                     <p>Every Elector bears the Arms of his own Houſe, but he <hi>Quarters Gules, a Wheel Argent,</hi> which are the Arms of the Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. It is ſaid, that the Original of theſe Arms came from the<note n="*" place="margin">

The City is indifferently large, but not much Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, and the Univerſity in no very good Condition. However, the ſituation makes amends, which is very pleaſant, and the Country about it is excellently good.</p>
                     <p>You know that the Elector of <hi>Mentz,</hi> is the firſt of the Eccleſiaſticks, and Dean of the Electoral College.

                     <p>This Bull was given at <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> in the Year 1356. by the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> IV. with the conſent of all the States of the Empire. The deſign of the Inſtitutors was, that this Edict ſhould be perpetual and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable, yet<note n="*" place="margin">Particularly in the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia.</hi>
                        </note> many Innovations have been made ſince. It deſcribes particularly the form of the Election of the Emperour, or<note n="†" place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the ſence of the Bull, are but one Perſon. In it he is often called Head of the Faithful, and firſt Prince of the Chriſtian World. The Bull is written in <hi>Latin.</hi>
                        </note> the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whom it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſtiles the Temporal Head of the Chriſtian World. It regulates many things that relate to the Electors, touching their Rank, their Aſſemblies, their Rights and Immunities, the Right of Succeſſion to the Electorate, and the Manner after which every one of them is to perform his Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in publick Ceremonies. It ordains theſe Princes to aſſemble once in the Year to ſettle the Affairs of the Empire. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> in conjunction with the Elector Palatine, are declared Regents, after the Death of the Emperour. But things, as you know, having been changed in favour of the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> that Elector pretends to the Regency. 'Tis a queſtion whether the Vicariat be affixed to the Electorate, in which the Duke of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi> was inveſted, or if it remain to the Houſe of the Counts Palatines.</p>
                     <p>Now, there is a King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> he is perpetual Vicar and Heir of the Empire. It was for this reaſon that <hi>Philip</hi> II. had only the Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> for his ſhare,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45740:40"/>
and that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his Uncle, who in the Life of <hi>Charles</hi> V. was elected King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> came to be Emperour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Francfort</hi> is the place appointed by the Bull, for the Election of the Emperour. Nevertheleſs, <hi>Henry</hi> II. was choſen at <hi>Mentz,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> III. at <hi>Aix la Chappelle;</hi>

This Bull contains many Regulations, which I ſhall not at preſent relate.</p>
                     <p>The famous Treacle of <hi>Francfort</hi> is made there by Doctor <hi>Peters,</hi> who is a skilful Apothecary, and in other reſpects a very curious Perſon. There are more than an hundred ſeveral Drugs that enter this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which are to be ſeen ranged in Pyramids, on a long Table. The Doctor hath many Antiquities, and other Rarities, amongſt which he highly values a Stone taken out of a humane Body, which is as big as ones head, and coſt him 1600 Crowns.</p>
                     <p>There are in this place a great number of <hi>Jews,</hi> but they are as beggarly as thoſe of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> are rich. They wear their Beards piqued, and have black Cloaks, with

                     <p>AS we took Coach at <hi>Francfort</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on our Journey, we obſerved the Coachman to put a little Salt upon each of his Horſes, with certain little Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which made part of the Myſtery; and this, as he told us, was to bring us good Luck, and to preſerve us from Charms and Witchcraft, during our Voyage.</p>
                     <p>We paſſed the <hi>Rhine</hi> at <hi>Gernſheim,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had gone through Woods that were drowned, by the overflowing of that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, (which made the ways both dangerous and difficult) we found them very good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

                           <hi>Worms</hi> was formerly an Arch Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick But Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the See to <hi>Mentz,</hi> to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Arch-biſhop <hi>Gervil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> who, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Faith, killed a Man, whom he invited out of the Camp of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> his Enemies, to have a familiar conference with him. <hi>Heiſs.</hi> This is a poor Biſhoprick.</note> The Biſhop hath a great Power there, though it be a free and Imperial City. It is near as large as <hi>Francfort,</hi> but poor, melancholy and ill peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled. They ſhewed me a Houſe that was lately ſold for a thouſand Crowns, which had been Lett formerly for a thouſand Crowns <hi>per Annum.</hi> There are many void places in this City, in which they have planted ſo many Vines, that they yield eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Year fifteen hundred Foudres of Wine: the Fouder is a Cask which holds about two hundred and fifty <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gallons. They highly prize this Wine, and they have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>That it is ſweeter than the Virgins Milk.</hi> The City preſents it to Perſons of Quality, as they paſs by, as alſo Fiſh and Oats. The Fiſh is to ſhew the Right of Fiſhing, which they have on the <hi>Rhine;</hi> but what the Oats ſignifie I know not: it cannot be to repreſent their Territory, becauſe they have none. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> have here a Church; and, beſides that, they preach by turns with the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> in that of the <hi>Dominicans;</hi> the reſt belong to the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> who carry not the Hoſt publickly, nor make any Proceſſion, except the Day after <hi>Eaſter.</hi> The <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi>

whom I will ſtill call <hi>Calviniſts</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> have their Church at <hi>Newhawſel</hi> in the Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, about half a League from the City; the <hi>Lutherans</hi> are not ſhy ſometimes to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten their Children there, which is directly oppoſite to the Practice of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> at <hi>Francfort.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They ſay, that a Lord of the Houſe of <hi>Alberg,</hi> having brought a great many <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> ſold Thirty of them for a Piece of Silver, at the City of <hi>Worms:</hi> where they were for a long time treated as Slaves, before they could obtain the Liberty which they at preſent enjoy in common with the other Inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>The Church of St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to be an ancient Building, but I believe that of St. <hi>John</hi> is the older. This laſt is built with very great ſquare Stones, and its Figure is quite irregular. The Walls are above twelve Foot thick, the Windows are narrow, and there are Galleries all round the outſide of the Building juſt under the Roof. There is but little Appearance that this was built for a Church: the Cathedral is a long Structure of a conſiderable Height, with a Tower at each of the four Corners; the whole Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is very maſſive, and embelliſhed with <hi>Gothick</hi> Ornaments. They ſhewed us a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Animal, over one of the Doors of this Church, of which the People tell a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Stories. This Animal is as big as an Aſs, and hath four Heads; one Head of a Man, one of an Oxe, one of an Eagle,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45740:42"/>
and one of a Lion: it lifts up the two firſt, and hangs down the other two. The right Foot before is a Man's, the left an Oxe's, the two hinder Feet are of an Eagle and a Lion: and a Woman ſits upon the Beaſt. If I durſt penetrate into this Myſtery, I think it might be conjectured, that this Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphick is a Chimera compoſed of the four Animals in the Viſion of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and that the Woman repreſents the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>I took notice of a Picture, over the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of one of the Chapels of this Church, in which the Virgin is repreſented receiving Chriſt as he deſcends from the Croſs, while ſeveral Angels carry the Inſtruments of the Crucifixion to Heaven. But either the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has forgot, or elſe the Angels have ſince brought back all theſe Reliques.</p>
                     <p>There is another very curious Picture, at the Entrance of the Church of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> over a moveable Altar. This Picture is about five Foot Square. God the Father is on the Top of one Corner, from whence he ſeems to ſpeak to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who is on her knees in the midſt of the Picture: ſhe holds the little Infant Jeſus by the Feet, and puts his Head into the Hopper of a Mill: the twelve Apoſtles turn the Mill by a Wheel, with their Hands, and they are aſſiſted by theſe four Beaſts of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which we juſt ſpoke of, who work on the other ſide. Not far off the Pope kneels to receive the Hoſts, which fall from the Mill ready made into a Cup of Gold. He preſents one to a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45740:43"/>
the Cardinal gives it to a Biſhop, the Biſhop to a Prieſt, and the Prieſt to the People.</p>
                     <p>There are in the City two publick Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; one of which is called the Burgher's Houſe, in which the Senate aſſembles twice every Week, about the Affairs of the State: the other is for the Magiſtracy, and is the Place where common Cauſes are pleaded. It was in the firſt that <hi>Luther</hi> made his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance on an occaſion known to all the World. They tell us, that this Doctor, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpoke with much eagerneſs, and being beſides heated by the fire which was before him, ſome body brought him a Glaſs of Wine, which he receiv'd; but ſuch was his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence, that he forgot to drink, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thinking of it, ſet it on a Bench which was by his ſide: they add, that the Glaſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after broke without any Perſon's touching it, and it paſſed for current that the Wine was poiſoned. I will make no Gloſs upon this Story. But afterwards the Bench on which he ſet the Glaſs was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ſome Pieces were taken out of it, which ſome zealous <hi>Lutherans</hi> keep in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their Maſter.</p>
                     <p>We went alſo to ſee another Houſe, which they call the Mint; in which, among other things, I obſerved a<note n="*" place="margin">Theſe two Verſes are written on the Top of the Leaf.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45740:43"/>
are twelve ſorts of Hands written, very fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with many Miniatures and Draughts boldly traced with a Pen. It was written by one <hi>Thomas Schuveiker,</hi> who was born without Arms, and perform'd this with his Feet. They alſo ſhew another little round piece of Vellum, about the bigneſs of a Guiney, upon which the Lord's-Prayer, without abbreviation, is written. But this is no extraordinary thing. I know a<note n="*" place="margin">Maximin Moſſileni.</note> Man who wrote the ſame Prayer ſix times in the ſame compaſs, more diſtinctly. This Houſe hath a long <hi>Portico,</hi> between the Arches of which hang great Bones and Horns. They ſay the Bones are the Bones of Giants, and the Horns the Horns of the Oxen which drew the Stones with which the Cathedral is built. And are not theſe very curious and venerable Pieces? The outſide of the Houſe is full of ſeveral Pictures, amongſt which there are many of Armed Giants, which in the Inſcription below are called <hi>Vangiones.</hi> We know very well that the People who formerly inhabited this part of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> were called <hi>Vangiones,</hi> as we find in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and others. But I cannot tell the reaſon, why they would have theſe <hi>Vangiones</hi> to be Giants. Nevertheleſs, theſe great Men there make a great noiſe at <hi>Worms,</hi> they tell a thouſand Stories of them, and when they have done, every one is at liberty to ſay what he pleaſes of them.</p>
                     <p>We only paſſed by <hi>Frankendal,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">FRANKEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAL.</note> the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications of which are pretty good, and would be better if they were lined; but
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45740:44"/>
they are forced to ſlope them too much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the too ſoft and ill cemented Earth could not otherwiſe be ſupported. This defect is yet apparently greater in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications of <hi>Manheim.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">MANHEIM.</note> Theſe two little places belong to the Elector Palatine. 'Tis but two hours Travel from one to the other. The ſituation of <hi>Manheim</hi> is its greateſt Strength: For it is not commanded by any riſing Ground, and is almoſt ſurrounded by the <hi>Neckar</hi> and the <hi>Rhine.</hi> There is a good Gariſon in the Citadel, but the greateſt Rarity that I found in it is the Temple of Concord. The Elector <hi>Charles Louis,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Charles the Laſt,</hi> Deceaſed, cauſed this Church to be built, to ſerve in common for the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> both <hi>Calviniſts</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans.</hi> But this Prince being of a pleaſant Humour, and not very ſcrupulous about Religion, the firſt day they Preach'd in this Church, permitted a Curate of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood to Preach there alſo; who made rather an Encomium of the Prince, than a Sermon. But they pretended not then that this was to be continued by courſe, and after that time the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> with the other Reformiſts, ſolely made uſe of the Church. But in fine, this preſent Elector being a <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> hath thought fit to joyn thoſe of his Communion with the others. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his Will, which is moſt ſtrong and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, he pretends this reaſon, that it is not contrary to the Will of the Founder, which he proves from the Harangue of the Curate. Therefore now the three Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45740:44"/>
of the three Religions, perform each in their turn the Service in the Church of Concord. They begin and end ſucceſſively, in ſuch manner as in three ſucceſſive Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, each of the three Miniſters hath the priviledge to begin firſt, as alſo to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third. The Church is not great, but is very fine. The Pulpit is in common, when the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> have ended Maſs, they draw the Curtain, and hide the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</p>
                     <p>About forty Years ago, <hi>Manheim</hi> was but a little Village, <hi>Frederick,</hi> Father of <hi>Charles Louis,</hi> cauſed it to be fortified, and named it <hi>Fredericksburg;</hi> at the ſame time this City was built, which reſum'd the name of <hi>Manheim,</hi> and was fortified alſo. All the Streets are in ſtraight Lines, and in ſome are Trees planted, as in <hi>Holland. Manheim</hi> is a very pretty place. Every day at five of the Clock in the Morning, at Noon and at ſix in the Evening, there are hired Muſicians, who ſing part of a Pſalm on the Tower of the Town-houſe. They have ſuch loud Inſtruments that they are heard all over the Town. This is done in moſt places of the Palatinate.</p>
                     <p>When we left <hi>Manheim,</hi> after we had paſſed the <hi>Neckar,</hi> over a Bridge of Boats, we traverſed a very fertile Plain, which continued for three hours, to the foot of the Mountains of <hi>Heidelberg.</hi> Theſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains make a long ridge as if they would hinder ones going further: Yet there we met with an opening, through which the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45740:45"/>
                        <hi>Neckar</hi> goes out. This River is paſſed over on a cover'd Bridge, and you find the City of <hi>Heidelberg</hi> on the other ſide, which lies high and low amongſt the Trees and Rocks. It is no very fine City, and I know not by what Spirit of Contradiction, they have built it almoſt all of Wood, whereas they might have had good Stone in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. The Prince's Palace is upon an aſcent, it conſiſts of many Pieces begun and not finiſhed.<note n="*" place="margin">This City was Storm'd, and utterly laid waſte by the <hi>French, May 22. 1693.</hi>

rich and well peopled. It is ſaid to be twice greater than <hi>Francfort;</hi> and it hath ſeven other Cities in its Territory, with four hundred and eighty Boroughs and Villages. Its Fortifications are of little eſteem in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of thoſe that are now in uſe: but it enjoys a profound Peace: and being in the Heart of <hi>Germany,</hi> its Neighbours preſerve it while they defend themſelves. Should the Emperour be Maſter of <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> as he is of his hereditary Countries, it would not be very advantageous to him: for at the bottom, as free as theſe little States are, they are nevertheleſs Slaves to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, being, at the ſame time, Fiefs of the Empire; they are made to contribute Men, Arms, and Money on occaſion: and there are a thouſand ways found to vex them, if they perform not the things required of them.</p>

                        <hi>Nuremberg</hi> is a very fair City, though the Structure of its Buildings is ſomewhat <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic,</hi> and not at all agreeable to the true Rule of Architecture. The Houſes are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally great, handſome and ſtrongly built. Some are covered with Pictures on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and almoſt all the reſt are of very fine hewen Stone. There are many Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Braſs in ſundry places of the City: we ſaw a very magnificent one, which is yet at the Artificers houſe, on which there are Braſs Statues to the Value of Seventy thouſand Crowns, beſides other Ornaments. The Streets are broad, clean, and well pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but it is Pity they are not more ſtrait.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45740:48"/>
The Tradition of the Country will have <hi>Nuremberg</hi> to be built by <hi>Nero,</hi> and there is one of the Towers of the Caſtle which is called the Tower of <hi>Nero,</hi> but this is but a poor Argument; I rather think that <hi>Nori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berga,</hi> called alſo in Latine <hi>Mons Noricorum,</hi> was derived from <hi>Noricum,</hi> the old Name of the Country, and the word <hi>Berg,</hi> which in high Dutch ſignifies a Mountain.</p>
                     <p>The Caſtle is on a high Rock, though the reſt of the City be flat enough. The Form of the Caſtle is wholly irregular, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have been forced to make it agreeable to the Maſs of the miſhapen and unequal Rock. They aſſur'd us that the Well in it was ſixteen hundred Foot deep, but none of us would believe them; they alſo told us that the Chain of the Bucket weighs three thouſand Pounds. We ſaw in one of the Halls of this Caſtle, four <hi>Corinthian</hi> Pillars, about fifteen Foot high; which, they ſay, the Devil brought from <hi>Rome,</hi> upon a Challenge which a Monk made him. The Story would be too tedious to relate at length. They tell another of a famous Conjurer of the Country, who leap'd on horſeback over the Caſtle Ditches, and ſhew the Print of the Horſes Shoes on the Stones of the Parapet.</p>
                     <p>The Ornaments which are uſed, at the Anointing of the Emperour, are kept in the Church of the Hoſpital.</p>
                     <p>The Diadem or the Crown, called alſo the<note place="margin">This is the Crown of <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemain,</hi> it weighs fourteen pounds.</note>

Suppoſe that inſtead of the Fleurets on Ducal Coronets, there are the Plates rounded on the top, which are joined by the ſides, and make the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the Bonnet. There are ſeven of them, and that before is the moſt richly adorned. There is a Croſs on the top of all, and a Semicircle ſupported between the two head Plates behind, which is rais'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Bonnet, and joined to the top of the Croſs. The Sceptre and Globe are of Gold, and they ſay that the Sword was brought by an Angel from Heaven. The Robe of <hi>Charlemain</hi> is of Violet Colour, embroidered with Pearls; the Imperial Cloak is edg'd with Pearls, and ſtrew'd with Eagles of Gold, and a great number of Jewels: there are likewiſe the Cope, the Stole,<note n="*" place="margin">Embroider'd with Stones.</note> the Breeches, the Stockins and the<note n="†" place="margin">cover'd with Plates of Gold.</note> Buskins. They alſo keep many Reliques in this Church; and amongſt others, the Iron Head of bleſſed St. <hi>Longin</hi>'s Lance. They are not ignorant that the pretended Head of this Lance is to be ſeen in above ten other places of the World; but, ſay they, theirs<note n="‖" place="margin">Lancea Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini reperta eſt in Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia à quidam ruſtico cui be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atus Andreas &amp; locum oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendit.

                        </note> There are two great Halls in it, each of two hundred and fifty paces long, and well repleniſhed with Arms.

There are many of thoſe great Cannons of a monſtrous Bore, which they call Mermaids and Baſilisks; and the biggeſt of theſe Pieces carries a three hundred pound Ball.</p>
                     <p>We alſo ſaw the Library; it is in a Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter which formerly belonged to the <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans,</hi> and contains, as they tell you, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Volumes. This was collected out of the Ruines of many Convents, in the Time of the Reformation. The moſt ancient Manuſcript is of nine hundred Years; it is a Copy of the Goſpels with the Prayers and Hymns formerly uſed in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church. The Character is very different from that now in uſe.<note place="margin">It is a Treatiſe of Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> I obſerved a Book which was printed at <hi>Spire,</hi> in the Year 1446. but there might be an Errour in the Cyphers, for they ſhewed us another of the Impreſſion of <hi>Fauſtus</hi> at <hi>Mentz,</hi> in 1459. at the End whereof there is an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement, by which it is ſaid, <hi>That this Book was not written by the Hand, but was printed by an admirable Secret newly invented.</hi> 'Tis probable that this was the firſt Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45740:50"/>
which was made at <hi>Mentz:</hi> and if it be ſo, there is no ground to ſuppoſe that another Book was printed at <hi>Spire,</hi> thirteen Years before: nor had <hi>Fauſtus</hi> any reaſon to boaſt ſo much of his new Secret. I have heard that there is another Impreſſion of <hi>Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>'s <hi>Officiale</hi> at <hi>Baſil,</hi> printed by <hi>Fauſtus</hi> in the ſame Year 1549.</p>
                     <p>They keep in this Library many Rarities, and curious Antiquities, but they are not comparable to thoſe that are in the Cabinet of Mr. <hi>Viati.</hi> We ſaw it in a great Chamber quite fill'd with divers Arms of all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, all Uſes, and all Faſhions. It is ſcarce to be conceived how a ſingle Man, and he a private Perſon, who hath not the Means of a Prince or a very great Lord, could heap together ſo many things; for the Number is very great, and, I believe, brought from all the four Quarters of the World. He ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us the Experiment of a Wind-Gun, which is a very pretty, but a moſt deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Invention, becauſe with this Engine great Miſchiefs may be done a far off, and without any Noiſe. From this Chamber you may go into another, where there are rare Pictures, Medals, curious Works anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and modern, Idols, Shells, Plants, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, and other natural Productions.</p>
                     <p>The Town-Houſe is very great, and has a very beautiful and well-proportion'd Front, but it wants a Court before it. When we went from thence, our Friends brought us to the City Cellar, which is two hundred and fifty Paces long, and contains, as they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45740:50"/>
tell us, Twenty thouſand Aums of Wine, that is to ſay, Twenty thouſand middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiz'd Tuns. We muſt allow it to be a very fair Cellar: but the truth is, ſuch Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as we, know not how to enjoy all the Pleaſures of it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> are, you know,<note place="margin">Germanorum vivere bibere eſt.</note> ſtrange Drinkers; but there are no People in the World more obliging, more civil, or more officious, and yet they have terrible Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms as to the Point of Drinking. Every thing is done there by drinking, and they drink in all they do. There is not time given to ſpeak three Words in a Viſit, but preſently comes the Collation, or at leaſt ſome large Jacks of Wine, with a Plate full of Cruſts of Bread haſh'd with Pepper and Salt, a fatal Preparative for puny Topers. But before we proceed I muſt give you an account of thoſe ſacred and inviolable Laws that are afterwards to be obſerv'd. Every Draught muſt be a Health, and aſſoon as you have emptied your Glaſs, you muſt preſent it full to him whoſe Health you drunk. You muſt never refuſe the Glaſs which is preſented, and you muſt drink it off to the laſt drop. Do but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect a little on theſe Cuſtoms, and ſee how it is poſſible to leave off drinking: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they never make an end,<note n="*" place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> ſai h in his Voyage, that the <hi>Germans</hi> have ſucceeded better than all the Mathematicians of the World in finding out the perpetual Motion, by the continual Agitation of their Cups.</note> but ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſe in a perpetual Round: to drink in <hi>Germany</hi> is to drink eternally.

Entertainment in the Cellar. You muſt do penance there for ſome time, and at laſt hide your ſelf behind the Casks, ſteal away and make your eſcape.</p>
                     <p>You muſt further know, that the Glaſſes are as much reſpected in this Country as the Wine is beloved. They place them all <hi>en Parade.</hi> The greateſt part of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are wainſcotted, even to two thirds of the Walls, and the Glaſſes are ranged all about, upon the Corniſh of the Wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcot, like Pipes of Organs. They begin with the Little, and end with the Great ones; and theſe Great ones are always us'd, and muſt be empty'd at a draught, when there is any Health of Importance. At going out of the Cellar we went to Conſort, where we hoped we ſhould do nothing but ſing, but the Bread, the Pepper, the Salt, and the Wine followed in ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, that an Air was no ſooner finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the whole Company roſe up to drink.</p>

                     <p>The Husband was in Black Cloaths, with a Cloak over-laid with Lace, a great Ruff, and a little Crown of Gold Plate-Lace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his Peruke. But the Wife's Dreſs will be a little more difficult to deſcribe. The beſt Account I can give you of it, is to tell you, That in framing to your ſelf an Idea of her Head-Tire, you muſt fanſie a Mixture of Plate-Wire gilded, like a Bob-Peruke, half a Foot higher than her Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and very much frizzed and ſwelled out on the Sides. This was ordered after ſuch a manner, that in all the Thickneſs of this Buſh there was no more ſpace or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between the Threads, than was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to faſten to them an infinite Number of little Plates of Gold, round, poliſhed and ſhining, which hung both within and without, and waved with the leaſt Motion. Her Habit was Black, with long Skirts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the <hi>Hongrelines</hi> which were not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long ſince uſed in <hi>France.</hi> The Body of this little Caſſock, which was cut very ſhort, had a Gold Lace over all the Seams. The Skirts were full of little cloſe Knots of black Sattin Ribbon, and the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45740:54"/>
ſtreight Cuffs fell juſt on the Fiſt. Over this ſhe had a Neck-band of Fine Antique Lace, cut before like a Man's Band, and ending in a Point behind, which reached down to the middle of the Back. She had beſides a great Gold Chain on her Shoulders, juſt like the Collar of ſome Order, and ſuch another Chain for her Girdle. Her Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoat was ſhort enough, and adorn'd below with Gold Fringe and Black Bone-Lace. We had the Pleaſure to ſee this Fair one dance with a Senatour in a great Ruff; and I believe at <hi>Japan</hi> there could not be found Cuſtoms more different from ours, than thoſe which we obſerved at this Feaſt. I ſhould never make an End if I ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to deſcribe all the other Habits. But, as fantaſtical as all theſe Dreſſes might ſeem at firſt view, one might be eaſily accuſtom'd to them, and every Habit appears hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and becoming, when the Perſons that wear them are of themſelves beautiful and agreeable.</p>

Others believe that it was one named <hi>Bertrand</hi> the Black of <hi>Chioggia.</hi> But <hi>Tavernier,</hi> and many other Travellers, pretend that this Invention came from <hi>China,</hi> as well as that of <hi>Printing.

                        </note> Fire-Arms, as well as that of Cannon-Powder. Others affirm that this Powder was invented at <hi>Chioggia,</hi> in the State of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice;</hi> and there are ſome who pretend that it came from <hi>Denmark.</hi> All <hi>Europe</hi> is fill'd
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45740:54"/>
with the little Curioſities of <hi>Nuremberg.</hi> There are ſome of Wood, of Ivory, of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labaſter, and even of Paper and Starch. Their Houſes are large and neat, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is not a Ceiling in all the City, which is not accompanied with an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetting of very fine Joyner's-Work. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expreſs the Particular Kindneſs they have for Horns; for all their Houſes are full of them. They are every where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Pictures, and other curious things. You often ſee in the fineſt Chamber, a Stag's, or Bull's Head, with a magnificent Pair of Horns hanging on the Ceiling, without any other Deſign but for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>We were but poorly treated on all the Road from <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> and Straw was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly our Bed. But we made our ſelves amends at <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> where the Houſes of Entertainment have very good Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. They ſerv'd us every Day with late Fruits, which I never ſaw any where elſe. We are here at the end of <hi>November,</hi> and commonly eat very good Fiſh.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Sebald</hi> is the principal Church where they ſhow a Wooden Crucifix which paſſeth for a Maſter-piece. The Church of St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> is the biggeſt of all. Theſe are both <hi>Gothick,</hi> but the laſt hath Eight Doors, which is look d upon as a ſingularity. The great Church-yard is worth the ſeeing: There are in it above Three Thouſand Tombs with Epitaphs, and Coats of Arms wrought in Braſs. No <hi>Jews</hi> are ſuffer'd to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45740:55"/>
live in the City, becauſe they formerly Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned the Fountains.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45740:55"/>
ſtrongeſt place. It is indifferently large. The moſt part of the Houſes are painted or whited without. The Streets are broad, ſtraight, and well pav'd: And the whole City ſeemed pleaſant enough, though it be poor and ill Peopled. They boaſt much of the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> but you muſt be put to trouble to obtain liberty to ſee it, ſo that we would not take the pains. I know very well that theſe inacceſſible Arſenals are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the worſt provided for; if they were well filled and furniſhed, they would make a publick Show of them, rather than hide them. But they excuſe themſelves upon ſome ſecret Reaſons, when they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſhow but Croſs-Bows and ruſty Firelocks. Nothing is more eaſily obtain'd, than the ſight of the Arſenals of <hi>France,</hi> and it is as true, that nothing is finer and in better order.</p>
                     <p>I obſerv'd at <hi>Ingolſtadt,</hi> as in moſt of the other Cities of <hi>Germany,</hi> that every where near the Fountains there are Casks of Wood or Braſs, mounted on little Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages with four Wheels, which ſerve to carry Water when any Fire happens. And this is very wiſely contriv'd; But they have another Cuſtom throughout all this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which we thought much more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome than uſeful. Theſe are certain Singers in the Night, who trot about every hour: They gave notice to beware of Fire, and afterwards exhort us to ſleep quietly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſidering that their horrid Muſick keeps all the City awake.</p>

                        <note place="margin">NEW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOURG.</note>We came from <hi>Ingolſtadt</hi> to <hi>Newbourg,</hi> which is a very little City, and without Fortifications. It ſtands on the right Bank of the <hi>Danube,</hi> which is grown broad and rapid, tho' at this place, it be very far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from its main ſtrength. We paſt it over a Bridge to go up into the City, at our entry we had a view of the Caſtle, which is ſeated on a Rock. Though the outſides are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ornaments, yet they make a handſome appearance. Within there are great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, even with the Ground, which are very convenient. But the <hi>Elector Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine,</hi> to whom this <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Newbourg</hi> belongs, was conſtrain'd to ſend all the Furniture of this Caſtle to that of <hi>Heidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> this laſt being ſtripp'd, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told you: There remains only one Cabinet, which is full of rare Pictures and other Curioſities, which we had not time to examine particularly. I remember to have obſerved a round piece of very hard Stone, which weighs four pound, and was found in the Body of a Horſe: I believe we might juſtly call this Stone a kind of <hi>Bezoar,</hi> ſince according to the report of <hi>Tavernier,</hi> the <hi>Bezoar</hi> is found in the Paunches of Cows and Apes, as well as in thoſe of Goats.</p>
                     <p>The Church of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> is the faireſt in the City, but there is a pleaſant thing to be ſeen in that of St. <hi>Peter, Mark d'Aviano,</hi> the <hi>Capouchin,</hi> famous for the Miracles which are attributed to him, was at <hi>Newbourg,</hi> about five Years ſince. As he went into
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:45740:56"/>
St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, he perceiv'd in a corner an old <hi>Noſtradame</hi> of Wood, which was all mangl'd, and covered over with Duſt. The zealous Father could not without Grief be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our <hi>Lady</hi> in ſo unbecoming a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He proſtrated himſelf before her, and began to thump his Breaſt, and to break out into Lamentations. As he was in the midſt of his Groans, he ſuddenly cry'd out. <hi>A Miracle!</hi> and proteſted that the good <hi>Lady</hi> had mov'd her Eyes, and look'd on him. There were then many old Women in the Church, who ran to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the cries of the <hi>Capouchin,</hi> and with joy embraced the occaſion that they were able to ſay, that they had been witneſſes to a Miracle: There was no need of many Arguments to convince them, for they all cried out with the <hi>Capouchin,</hi> that our <hi>Lady</hi> had look'd upon him: Immediately he went out with them, and fill'd all the City with the noiſe of the pretended Miracle. He was ſupported by the great ones, and after certain Preambles, which 'tis needleſs to relate, they went to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion: They cleaned the Statue, took the Sacrament off the great Altar which was dedicated to it, dreſs'd our <hi>Lady</hi> in a ſplendid Habit, and plac'd her on that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, where ſhe works Miracles by Millions. The Princes and the People load her with Preſents, and People come from all parts in Pilgrimage to her.</p>

If the Streets be broader and ſtraiter, it is certain, that generally the Houſes are not ſo fine; they are commonly plaſter'd and whited without, or adorn'd with Pictures, I ſaw but very few of hewn Stone. All the floors of the Chambers are pav'd with a certain yellowiſh Marble which comes from <hi>Tirol;</hi> and the Ceilings are either of Joyners-work, with Compartiments, or of a certain Cement, which poliſhes very well, and is very durable.

It hath been pillag'd ſo often, particularly in the time of <hi>Attila,</hi> that there are ſcarcely any remains of its Antiquities to be found. It is I know not how long ſince, they dug out a Pillar five or ſix Foot high, over which was the figure of a Pine-Apple. There were alſo found ſome Medals of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> on the Reverſe of which the like Pillar is to be ſeen. As it was the uſual Cuſtom, to mark out by ſome bounds, the increaſe of the Empire, on the Frontiers of the Conquer'd Countries, and to joyn to thoſe limits ſome repreſentations of the things which were moſt common in the new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces: It is very probable, that this was the uſe of the Pillar I juſt now mention'd, and of the Pine-Apple which is over it; for all this part of <hi>Germany</hi> is full of Pines and Firr-Trees. There is alſo a great deal of appearance, that for this reaſon <hi>Ausbourg</hi> bears a <hi>Pine-Apple</hi> in its Arms.</p>
                     <p>Though there be hardly any thing good or regular in the Fortifications of this Town, yet hath it ſometimes ſuſtain'd very rude Aſſaults with much vigour. It is now
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45740:58"/>
Forty three Years, ſince the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>French</hi> beſieged it, and reduced it to Famine, without being able to take it. It is an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial City, and its Senate are half <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> and half <hi>Roman Catholicks:</hi> But this Senate is not the ſole Maſter of the State; five or ſix Sovereigns ſhare it among them. A good part belongs to the Biſhop: Almoſt all the Territory is his Demeſne; and he hath his Palace in the City, though he reſides at <hi>Dillengen,</hi> where alſo the Univerſity is. You know that all the Biſhops of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire are Temporal Princes in their Dioceſſes, except thoſe of the Hereditary Countries of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> here make publick Proceſſions, and carry the Hoſt publickly. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> commonly pull off their Hats when they cannot avoid meeting the Hoſt.</p>
                     <p>They do all they can poſſibly, to avoid giving ſcandal to either Party. The Poor of both Religions are put into the ſame Hoſpitals, and are there aſſiſted by their own Miniſters without any oppoſition.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> have a ſeparate place in the City; they are obliged to pay, when they reſort thither, a Florin <hi>per</hi> hour, which is a piece of Money worth about three Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Town-Houſe is a great four-ſquare Building, of very fair hewn Stone. The Portal is of Marble, and almoſt all the Rooms are Wainſcoted and Ciel'd with Aſh of <hi>Poland,</hi> which is very fine. The great Hall is extreamly Magnificent. It is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45740:58"/>
one hundred and ten foot long, fifty eight broad, and fifty two foot high; the Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is of green Marble. The Walls are covered with Paintings, between which there are many Devices and Emblems, which relate to the Government; but the Roof excells all the reſt in Beauty. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of Compartments, the Squares and Pannels of which are inriched with gilded Sculptures, and filled with Pictures and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ornaments. And this is all ſo well ordered and performed, that it deſerves a particular Obſervation.</p>
                     <p>The Arſenal is very great: The two Halls below are full of Cannon, of which the greateſt part are of Braſs. There is a Culverin of Leather twenty ſix foot long, which is a ſix Pounder. The upper Stories are filled with good Arms.</p>
                     <p>During the Wars of the Neighbouring Princes, in this laſt Age, the People of <hi>Ausbourg</hi> were careful to ſhut the Gates of the City early at Nights, which Cuſtom was troubleſome to Strangers, as well as to themſelves. Wherefore they invented a kind of ſecret Gate, by which there was Paſſage to come in, without fear of ſurprize or other danger. This Gate remains ſtill with all its Locks and Machines, and is a thing very ſingular. I have drawn a deſign of it, which I could ſhew you, but the deſcription would at preſent be too difficult and tedious.</p>
                     <p>The Trade of <hi>Ausbourg</hi> decay'd, as that of <hi>Holland</hi> increas'd. Almoſt all Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45740:59"/>
which come from the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> were formerly Landed at <hi>Venice,</hi> and from thence brought to <hi>Ausbourg,</hi> from which place they were diſpers'd through all <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> But <hi>Holland</hi> hath taken away all, and diſtributes all: And <hi>Ausbourg</hi> ſuffers as well as <hi>Venice, Milan, Antwerp,</hi> and an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of other Cities, which are at preſent as Poor as they were formerly Rich.</p>
                     <p>Three Years after <hi>Guſtavus the Great</hi> had made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Ausbourg,</hi> it was retaken by the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who took away all the Churches from the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> in which caſe they remained from the Year Thirty five, till Forty eight, at which time all things were reſtor'd by the Peace of <hi>Munſter.</hi> During which interval, the <hi>Lutherans</hi> had no liberty to aſſemble but in a College, from the Window of which they Preached to the People in the Court-yard. This College is ſtill in their Poſſeſſion; and I have ſeen a long Inſcription, which is Graved under the Window, and begins thus: <hi>Praecluſis omnibus Evangelicorum tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plis, coelum tamen ipſis patuit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All the Churches of the Profeſſors of the Goſpel being ſhut, Heaven was yet open to them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>You may ſee in the Biſhop's Palace, the Chamber where the famous Confeſſion of <hi>Ausbourg,</hi> was<note n="*" place="margin">In the Year <hi>1540.</hi> by <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> and <hi>Luther; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> drew it up.</note> preſented to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> V. From thence we went to the Cathedral, where there is a Gate of Braſs, over which many places of the Sacred Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory are repreſented in <hi>baſſo relievo,</hi> and they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:45740:59"/>
made us obſerve in the Hiſtory of the Creation, that it was the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> who created <hi>Eve,</hi> and form'd her out of one of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Ribbs.</p>
                     <p>They are no leſs ingenious at <hi>Ausbourg,</hi> than at <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> and even they excel par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in Clock and Goldſmiths-work, and in works in Ivory. We ſaw ſeveral Clocks which were valued at fifteen or twenty thouſand Crowns, they are plac'd in caſes that are very richly wrought. And beſides what relates to the motion of the Stars, and the Diviſion of the Times and Seaſons, they adorn them with many other things, which would be both pleaſant and profitable, were they a little more laſting.</p>
                     <p>Their way of turning in Ivory is very curious, and deſerves to be taken notice of with admiration. But one of the rareſt Works which I ſaw here, I ſhall give you an account of: They are Glaſſes made hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and well ſhaped, with a Ring made of the ſame piece in turning, which plays be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the bottom and the bowl of the Glaſs, without poſſibility of taking off. There are an hundred with their Rings in a grain of Pepper of an ordinary ſize.<note place="margin">Theſe Glaſſes are in my hands.</note> I often examined this little Miracle of Art, and obſerved the ſtripes and traces of the Tool with which they are turned, ſo that I found no ſecret in it, but that it was the pure work of the Eyes and the Hand.</p>
                     <p>They have here another very pleaſant Bauble, which are Fleas faſtned by the Neck with Chains of Steel. This Chain is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45740:60"/>
ſo fine, that though it be near a Span long, the Flea will lift it up when it leaps. The Animal, Chain and all is ſold for Ten Pence.</p>
                     <p>The variety of Habits, and difference of their Colours, is yet greater here than at <hi>Nuremberg.</hi> This is an Affair regulated by the Policy of the Magiſtrates, and you may know the Quality and Religion of the greateſt part of the People, by the difference of their Cloaths. I will only repreſent to you the manner after which the Widow of a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Merchant wears Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for her Husband. She hath a Chriſtning Kercher, well whited and ſtarched, with Wings and Cornets ordinary for this Dreſs, a black Petticoat, and a black Cloak, made like that of a Man, which comes to her Knees. A great white Veil behind, which hangs at the tail of the Kercher, down to her Heels, enlarging it ſelf by degrees; a piece of the ſame Linnen with the Kercher, four foot long, and at leaſt two broad, which is very much ſtarched and ſtretched on a ſquare of Wire-thred, faſtned by the middle of one of its ends, juſt below the Lips, and covers all the fore part of the Body.</p>

                     <p>I Obſerved at my going out of <hi>Ausbourg,</hi> in many Gardens, that they cover all their Vines and Fig-Trees, carefully with Straw or Mats, to preſerve them from the Froſt; the Cold being ſharper in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try than in <hi>England,</hi> where we are not obliged to make uſe of theſe Precautions, though we lie nearer the <hi>North.</hi> It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true, that the divers degrees of Heat and Cold, are not always proportion'd to the diverſity of Climates: There are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Winters in <hi>Canada</hi> in the midſt of the temperate Zone, whilſt every where elſe, under the ſame Climate, they enjoy a ſweet and pleaſant Air.</p>

                        <note place="margin">MUNICH.</note>The Country is level enough between <hi>Ausbourg</hi> and <hi>Munich,</hi> but it is not very good; it is every where a mixture of Wood and Fields, and Firr-Trees. <hi>Munich</hi> is not above half ſo big as <hi>Ausbourg.</hi> It is a fine City, but ill fortified, and has no Trade; and without doubt little notice would be taken of this place, if the Elector's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence were not there, and if that Prince's Palace were not extraordinarily Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Almoſt all the Houſes of the City are painted on the out-ſide, but inſtead of Painting in <hi>Freſco</hi> or in Oyl, they make uſe of a kind of bad Plaiſter, which is liable to all the Injuries of the Weather: It wears off quickly, and riſes hollow in many places, which maims all the Figures, and renders them very ugly.</p>
                     <p>We had heard ſome Perſons boaſt ſo much of the Jeſuits Library, that it was the firſt thing we would ſee when we came to <hi>Munich;</hi> but it did not anſwer our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations. For, beſides that, it is neither very good, nor well conditioned; they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Brother <hi>Cut-Cabbage,</hi> who knew better what belong'd to the Kitchin than to Books, to ſhew it us. I confeſs I could not believe ſuch groſs Ignorance could lurk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Habit of one who call'd himſelf a Jeſuite. It was abſolutely impoſſible for us to make him underſtand, what thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors were whom we called <hi>the Fathers.</hi> He preſently named all the Fathers of his Convent, to try if he could find out whom we looked for. And at laſt, with a ſcow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45740:63"/>
look, he pray'd us to talk of ſomething elſe. This is all I can tell you of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, and the Library-keeper, or at leaſt of his Deputy: For it is not very probable that all the reſt of this Society are of the ſame Stamp. However, they carry four fair and high Corners in their Caps; and their Houſe may be ſaid to be a ſtately Palace. Their Church is alſo extreamly fine; it is of but one Body, very high, large, and ſtrongly roofed; the Veſtry is full of Riches, and they want no Reliques: They ſhewed us a Joynt as big as that of an Elephant, or ſome huge Animal; and this great Bone, as we were inform'd, is in great veneration with them, as being one of the Joynts of great St. <hi>Chriſtopher</hi>'s Back-Bone.</p>
                     <p>Leaving the Church of the Jeſuites, we went to that of the <hi>Auguſtines,</hi> where are Pictures of great value.</p>
                     <p>We went thence to the <hi>Cajetans,</hi> who have a great and fair Church. I obſerv'd in a Map of <hi>Munich,</hi> that this City bears a Monk for its Arms,<note place="margin">This City was built in the Year <hi>962.</hi> by Duke <hi>Henry. Otho</hi> incloſed it with Walls, in <hi>1157.</hi>
                        </note> and that it is called <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacum,</hi> or <hi>Monachium,</hi> becauſe there was a Monaſtery on the place where it is built. We alſo went to ſee in the Church of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre Dame,</hi> the Tomb of the Emperor <hi>Louis</hi> IV. This Sepulchre is adorn'd with many fine Marble and Braſs Figures. Having advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Ten or Twelve Steps from the entrance of the great Door of this Church, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold one of the Stones of the Pavement, on which is a double Croſs; and it hath been obſerv'd, that when you ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45740:64"/>
in this Place, the Pillars of the Church are ſo placed, that you cannot ſee one of the Windows, though they are very many. All that come to Worſhip in thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches have a lighted Wax-Candle in their Hands; and that Candle is bigger or leſſer, according to the Quality of the Saint, or their Devotion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">There is an ample and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Deſcription of this Palace written in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> by the Marquiſs <hi>Ran. Pallavicino.</hi> This Royal Houſe contains, ſaith he, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Courts, Twenty great Halls, Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Galleries, Two Thouſand Six Hundred great Glaſs Windows, Six Chapels, Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen great Kitchens, and Twelve large Cellars, Forty vaſt Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one lower than the other, and in which you may diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Three Hundred great Chambers, richly Painted, Wainſcoated, Paved, Furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note>The out-ſide of the Elector's Palace is not ſuitable to the Magnificence within; and though the greateſt part of its Apartments are well contriv'd, it may be ſaid that they are all irregular: The reaſon is, that this great Maſs of Building was not erected at the ſame time, every one wrought accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Fancy of his Time, or his own private Judgment; and that hath been the cauſe of the diſ-proportionableneſs of its Parts: But if it be taken altogether, it may certainly paſs for a very beautiful Structure. You muſt not expect that I ſhould give you an ample Deſcription of a Place that is ſo vaſt, and ſo full of Rarities. I tell you in general, that all ſorts of Beauties and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are found there in abundance. The great Hall of the Emperour's Apartment is One Hundred and Eighteen Foot in length, and Fifty Two Feet in breadth. We may juſtly ſay, that it is in every reſpect Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent. All its Pictures are highly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: They are Hiſtories, the Sacred on one ſide, and the Prophane on the other; there are <hi>Latine</hi> Verſes to every Hiſtory. I will
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45740:64"/>
ſet down the Diſtick for <hi>Suſanna,</hi> becauſe I think it one of the beſt:

They keep a a great many Reliques there, among which I took notice of a piece of Gold Mohair, which, they ſay, was part of one of the Virgin's Robes.</p>
                     <p>The Parlour of Perſpectives is one of the fineſt things of this Palace: But the Hall of<note n="†" place="margin">The greateſt part of theſe Antiquities were brought from <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </note> Antiquities is famous all the World o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. I counted One Hundred Fourſcore and Twelve Buſts, and above Four Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred other Pieces: All theſe are choice and rare, for the Beauty of their Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, as well as their Antiquity. The greateſt part of the Furniture of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace is very rich; and they affirm that there are Eight Millions of Crowns-worth of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtry in the Wardrobe,<note place="margin">The Sum per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is a little too big.</note> beſides what is in ordinary uſe. But the Treaſury infinitely exceeds all the reſt. There are many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of Veſſels of Gold, and many other precious Veſſels. A prodigious quantity of great Pearls, Diamonds, Rubies, and other oriental Stones of exquiſite Beauties; and an infinite number of excellent Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, curious Works, Medals, and other Rarities. I cannot forget the Cherry-ſtone,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45740:65"/>
upon which you may diſtinctly perceive the graving of One Hundred and Forty Heads; nor the Boat of Palm-Wood turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Stone, on which they have inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed theſe two Verſes:

                     </p>
                     <p>Marble is to be found every where in this Palace, yet we muſt not cheat our ſelves; for they have the ſecret with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Compoſition to make it; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo hard, and poliſhes ſo well, that thoſe who are not very skilfull, take it for true Marble.</p>
                     <p>They have made divers<note n="*" place="margin">Walks under Ground.</note> Galleries of Communication, which croſs the Streets and Houſes, by which they can go pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately from the Palace to all the Churches and Convents of the City.</p>
                     <p>I will ſay nothing of the Arſenal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have carried the Cannon, and moſt of the beſt Arms, into <hi>Hungary.</hi> We ſaw there the Tent of the <hi>Grand Vizier,</hi> which was taken in the laſt Battel, in which the Elector did ſo remarkably ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize his Valour. This Tent was vaſtly great, but no way fine: It is made of Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Cloth printed, with the Strings, as they ſeem to me, of fine Sattin, cover'd with Silk Brede, and the Lozenges of the ſame, placed from one place to another, between the Strings.</p>

                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:45740:65"/>I cannot tell you why this Country is not proper for Vines; there are none in it, and their ordinary Drink is Beer.</p>
                     <p>They know no other Religion here but that of <hi>Rome:</hi> And they look upon Men as Wolves, that are not of that Profeſſion. Their principal Devotion is for the Virgin: She is painted on all their Houſes; every place is full of her Chapels and Oratories, and they beſtow Divine Titles on her.</p>

                     <p>AFter we had for ſome time follow'd the Banks of the <hi>Iſer,</hi> which is the River of <hi>Munich,</hi> we entred into a Foreſt; at our coming out of which, we ſaw di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly the beginning of the <hi>Alps:</hi> Their Snowy tops are mingled with the Clouds, and reſemble very much the ſwelling and foaming Waves of a tempeſtuous and raging Sea. If the Courage of thoſe has been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd, who firſt expos'd themſelves to the Fury of that Element, here is matter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of Aſtoniſhment, that any one
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45740:66"/>
ſhould venture himſelf among the Cavities of ſuch frightful Mountains.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Day we departed from <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nich,</hi> we came to a Village call'd <hi>Lagrem,</hi> which is at the Foot of the Mountains, and near to a little Lake of very freſh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; there they gave us Fiſh, whoſe Names we knew not. The firſt thing our Hoſt treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with, was a Chafing-Diſh full of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, with which he perfum'd our Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and truly we found more neatneſs in this little ſolitary Habitation, than in many great Cities in our Journey. After we had coaſted the Mountains about Two Hours, we entred there, and for a long time mounted amongſt the Rocks, Firr-Trees, and Snow. Nothing is more wild and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal than theſe places. Sometimes you find ſome Fiſher-men's Cottages, on the Banks of two or three Lakes, which are between the Mountains: But there is no ſign of any till'd Land; and probably a little Goat's Cheeſe, with ſome Fiſh, is the principal Diet of theſe poor People. Their Cabins are made of the Roots of Firr-Trees, well joined together, and their Boats are fram'd of the ſame Trees hollow'd. They gave us Goats Fleſh, and great Salmon-Trouts in the Village of <hi>Mittenwald,</hi> which is Three Leagues farther. This Village is in the middle of a pleaſant Plain, and the Rocks which environ it are extraordinary high. Our Hoſt ſhew'd us ſome Balls, or brown Maſſes, about the bigneſs of a Hen's Egg, or leſs, which are a kind of ſoft and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:45740:66"/>
                        <hi>Bezoar,</hi> and are commonly found in thoſe Parts, in the Stomachs of the Goats. The good Man aſſured us of their great Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and that he often ſold them to Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. He valued them at Ten Crowns a-piece; and I believe we ſhould have done him a Courteſie, if we had taken Five or Six which he had, at that price.</p>
                     <p>A little farther we met a very pleaſant Troop of Beggars; when they perceiv'd us at a good diſtance, one of them, who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a Tree loaden with Red Fruits, plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in the middle of the Way, and ſate down by the ſide of it; a little Demi-Devil in the ſhape of a Crocodile, faſtened himſelf to the Tree, and a Girl with long and diſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd Hair, approach'd to it; an old Fellow cloath'd in Black, with a Peruke and Beard of Moſs, ſtood at a little diſtance, with a young Boy clad in White, who held a Sword. When they thought we were near enough, the little Divel open'd the Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with a Balderdaſh Song, and we could without difficulty Divine, that all was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Hiſtory of the Fall. One of us as he paſſed by the Old Man, ask'd him, ſince he kept at a diſtance from them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was of the Company; the poor Mortal anſwer'd coldly, That he was God the Father, and that if we would ſtay a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, we ſhould ſee him act his part, with his little Dagger-carrier, which was St. <hi>Michael</hi> the <hi>Arch-Angel.</hi> Behold the Product of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations which they make of the Deity!</p>
                     <p>A quarter of an Hour after this fine Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, we paſs'd by the Fort of <hi>Chernitz,</hi>
                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:45740:67"/>
which is built between two inacceſſible Rocks, and which ſeparates the County of <hi>Tirol</hi> from the Biſhoprick of <hi>Freiſinghen.</hi> This Biſhoprick is in <hi>Bavaria;</hi> and <hi>Tirol</hi> is one of the Emperor's Hereditary Provinces. We came very late to the Village of <hi>Seefeld,</hi> after we had made many Turnings and Windings among the Mountains. There is a Convent of <hi>Auguſtines</hi> in this Village, and you may ſee in their Church two or three pretended Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, with which they make no ſmall noiſe.</p>
                     <p>They tell of a certain Gentleman, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Milſer,</hi> who lived at the Caſtle of <hi>Schlosberg,</hi> about a quarter of a League from thence; and was very much dreaded in this Village, that he was ſo vain as to deſire to communicate with the great Hoſt, which is only for the uſe of the Clergy: They endeavour'd to perſwade him out of this Fancy, but all in vain. When they had put the Hoſt into his Mouth, it caſt out, as they ſay, a Flood of Blood, and at the ſame time the Legs of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant ſunk into the Pavement up to the Knees: He would have ſupported himſelf on the Altar, but the Stone gave way, and ſoftned under his Hand, and the poor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Man had been ſwallow'd alive, if he had not been retriev'd by a ſpeedy Repentance. The <hi>Auguſtines</hi> ſhew this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Hoſt, chewed, and bloody, in a Repoſitory of Glaſs. They ſhew alſo the print of a Hand on one of the Stones of the Altar, and a Hole in the Pavement of the Church near the ſame Altar, as of two Legs ſunk into ſoft Ground. They ſay
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:45740:67"/>
that this Hoſt worketh Miracles; and they find it not inconvenient to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
                     <p>Two good Leagues on this ſide <hi>Seefeld,</hi> we began to deſcend, and three quarters of an Hour afterwards, we arriv'd in a deep Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, which was at leaſt a Mile in breadth. The River <hi>Inn</hi> glides pleaſantly along; and waters many not unhandſome Villages. We turn'd to the left in this Valley, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd always the Foot of the Mountain. And a little League farther, they made us obſerve a ſtraight and cragged Rock, which they ſaid was above an Hundred Fathom high, and was call'd <hi>The Emperor's Rock.</hi> About three quarters of the height of this Rock, there was a Nich dug,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>See</hi> Stephen Pegius <hi>in his</hi> Hercules Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicius.</note> in which there was a Crucifix, and a Statue on each ſide of it. They ſay that <hi>Maximilian</hi> I. being in chaſe of a wild Goat, alighted juſt at this place from the top of the Rock, which joins to the Mountains behind; and that the Emperour not daring to remount his Horſe, was feign to have recourſe to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines to get down.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Inſpruck</hi> is but Two ſhort Hours beyond the middle of the Valley,<note place="margin">INSPRUCK.</note> upon the River <hi>Inn:</hi> You paſs this River over a Bridge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you enter the City; and it is therefore called <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> that Word having the ſame ſignification in <hi>High-Dutch,</hi> as <hi>Aenipons,</hi> or <hi>Aenipontum</hi> in <hi>Latin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are very fine Houſes at <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> but the manner after which they cover them, ſeems at firſt to be troubleſome to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:45740:68"/>
thoſe who are not acquainted with them; for not only the Roofs are flat, but inſtead of the Rafters riſing to a Point, they are reverſed, and the Rain falls into the middle of the Roof.</p>
                     <p>After the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to loſe his Eſtates, the Emperour gave him the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Tirol;</hi> and the Reſidence of this Prince was at <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> in the Palace which was formerly the Arch-Duke's. This Palace hath many Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, and is of a ſufficient extent, but it was built at ſeveral times, and hath neither Beauty nor Regularity.</p>
                     <p>They ſhow'd us here one thing ſingular, of which I will endeavour to give you the moſt certain Account I could any way learn; though all my Induſtry to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſignify'd but little. The Houſe which they call the <hi>Chancery,</hi> is on the Place in the midſt of the City. The Portrait of this Houſe is like a little Porch without, to a Roof which is ſupported by the Wall of the Houſe; and they aſſure us that this Roof is cover'd with Plates of Gold. This is what they told us of it. A Rebellion, and almoſt general Sedition being rais'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an Arch-Duke call'd <hi>Frederick,</hi> whom they particularize no otherwiſe; that Prince was forc'd to hide himſelf, but not being willing to go far off, that he might be ready to Act, in caſe his Affairs ſhould be in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Poſture; he engag'd himſelf, ſay they, to ſerve a Miller in a Village of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mountain. In effect, the Troubles
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45740:68"/>
happen'd to be appeas'd, and <hi>Frederick</hi> was recall'd. But there was ſtill an Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit amongſt ſome of them, that jeer'd him, and gave him the Nick-name of <hi>Empty Purſe;</hi> to ſhew therefore that he was not ſo poor as thoſe People imagin'd, he affected to be prodigal of Gold, in employing that preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Metal on ſo vile a thing as that you now heard of.</p>
                     <p>This Hiſtory contains nothing impoſſible, and it was related to us for a certain Truth, by People who ſeem'd to me Wiſe and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: nevertheleſs, to ſpeak freely, I cannot but ſuſpect it. I believe no Author ever writ of it, and ſo ſingular a thing could not have been omitted. Perhaps ſomething not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to this did really happen, which might give occaſion to this Tradition.</p>
                     <p>I could not touch the Roof, becauſe it is a little too high, but I have attentively look'd upon it, and ſaw diſtinctly that the Plates of Braſs are placed on the Timber, and ſerve for Tiles; and I perceiv'd alſo that each of theſe Plates is cover'd with another thin one of other Metal, which ſeem'd to me to be about a Line in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If theſe laſt Plates are not of Gold, I am ſure they are gilded; but if there be but a ſimple Gilding, why Metal upon Metal? and why could they not alſo gild the Brazen Tiles?</p>
                     <p>The Roof may be about Fifteen Foot ſquare; and if it be of Gold, I find by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation that it coſt about Two hundred thouſand Crowns.</p>

                        <pb n="100" facs="tcp:45740:69"/>It was, as they ſay, the ſame <hi>Frederick,</hi> who caus'd Twenty eight fair Statues of Braſs to be made, which are in the Church of the <hi>Cordeliers.</hi> There are Emperours, Arch-Dukes, Dukes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> Two Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes, and Two Princeſſes, whom they knew not who they were: All are bigger than the Life. There is alſo to be ſeen in this Church a magnificent Tomb of the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> I.</p>
                     <p>We went alſo to ſee <hi>Amras,</hi> which is a Houſe of Pleaſure of the Arch-Duke's; This Houſe is a good half Hour from <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpruck,</hi> at the Foot of the Mountain; it hath no Beauty on any ſide, that we could obſerve, and its Situation is the only thing that makes it pleaſant. They have taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all the Furniture of ordinary uſe, but we found Galeries full of fine and very rare things. They led us preſently into a large Hall, where truly the Arms were more curious than uſeful. They made us take notice, amongſt other things, of an extraordinary great and heavy Lance, which the Arch-Duke <hi>Ferdinand</hi> uſed in Turnaments. They ſaid that Prince<note n="*" place="margin">The ſame is related of <hi>Lio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo du Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci,</hi> a Painter of <hi>Florence.</hi>
                        </note> could ſtop a Coach and Six Horſes, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hold of a Spoak of the Wheel; and that he broke with his Hands, two Crown-Pieces joined together: and I know not how many other prodigious things, more difficult to be believ'd than the Hiſtory of <hi>Frederick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We went out of this Hall into a Galery, where were to be ſeen many Princes upon
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45740:69"/>
their beſt Horſes, with all their Armour, and all the Ornaments they uſed in Turnaments. They alſo kept there the Skin of a Serpent, which is Fifteen Foot long, and which was taken near <hi>Ulm,</hi> on the Bank of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube.</hi> At the end of the Galery you go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Chamber, fill'd with Spoils and Arms taken from the <hi>Turks.</hi> A <hi>Baſſa</hi> and an <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> are repreſented on their Horſes, with the ſame Equipage they had when they were taken. Their Habits are very rich; and the Harneſs of their Horſes is yet much richer; they are loaded with Ornaments of Gold and Silver, Precious Stones, Damask-Works, and other <hi>Arabian</hi> Embelliſhments.</p>
                     <p>From this they brought us into another Galery, in which was a double Rank of great Cupboards, which were joined by the Backs and Sides, and which fill'd the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Galery, even to the top, ſo that there was but a little room left to walk round. The Three firſt Cupboards were full of Works of Alabaſter, Glaſs, Coral, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Pearl. In the Fourth were Medals and Money of Gold and Silver. The Fifth was garniſh'd with Veſſels of Porcelane, and Seal'd Earth. In the Sixth were many little Cabinets very rich, of curious inlaid Works; the Boxes were fill'd with Medals, and little Works of <hi>Agat</hi> and <hi>Ambergreeſe:</hi> There are Seven great Volumes cover'd with Black Velvet, with Plates and Claſps of Silver; and inſtead of Leaves they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain flat Boxes, which incloſe a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45740:70"/>
of Medals, ſo that theſe ſeven Volumes contain a compleat Hiſtory. In the ſeventh Cupboard are ancient or curious Arms: I I obſerved a Croſs-bow which included four and thirty Bows, and diſcharged thirty four Arrows at a flight. The eighth is full of Animals, Plants, and other Productions of Nature. That which is eſteemed the greateſt Rarity, is the Horn of an Oxe, which is ſix Inches diameter. There are alſo Works of Wood, of Ivory, and of the Pen, in the three following Cupboards. The twelfth is filled with Manuſcripts, and curious Books. It would grieve one to paſs this over ſlightly, becauſe thoſe who ſhow it know not its worth. In the thirteenth are only works of Steel, and particularly myſterious Padlocks, and other Locks of curious Invention. You ſee in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, Stones which repreſent Trees, Fruits, Shells, and Animals, all which are the pure product of Nature. The fifteenth and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth are full of all ſorts of Clock-work, and Inſtruments of Muſick. That which follows is full of precious Stones, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought, and with a great deal of unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd Metals and Minerals. In the eighteenth are many ſmall Veſſels of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Materials, and a very great number of the fineſt Shells in the World. The nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth is the moſt precious of all, it is full of Veſſels of Gold, Chryſtal, Agat, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedony, Onyx, Cornelian, <hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> and other precious Stones, all of it inrich'd with Gold and Diamonds, in <hi>baſſo releivo,</hi>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:45740:70"/>
and other Ornaments of moſt curious Workmanſhip. The twentieth and laſt is filled with Antiquities, Sepulchral Lamps, Urns, Idols, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They alſo keep here a piece of a Rope about the length of your hand, and tell you, that it is a piece of the Rope with which <hi>Judas</hi> hang'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>There are an infinite number of things faſtned to the Cieling and the Walls. The Bow of <hi>Noah,</hi> of the <hi>Baſſan,</hi> is the moſt eſteemed amongſt the Pictures, and it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually is an admirable Piece. They ſay the laſt great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> would have given an hundred thouſand Crowns for it. Beſides the Medals which I have told you of, and whoſe number is infinitely great, there is above a great Mule's Load, that lie huddled together in a Cheſt. When we parted from hence they brought us to the Library, which we found in very bad or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and our Guide could tell us nothing at all. From the Library we paſſed into a Galery, where there is a great number of Statues, Buſts, and other Pieces of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and we ſaw afterwards a great many Chambers hung round with Pictures of great Price.</p>
                     <p>This Bill of Parcels is a little long, but I hope it will not be tedious to you. At laſt I muſt not forget to tell you of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant at our Inn,<note place="margin">

him up with this Hand only, and carries him from one end of the Room to the other.</p>

                     <p>A Small League from <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter'd into the Mountains, and for ſeven hours together did nothing but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend; this was the moſt troubleſome day's Journey we had all the way. A place ſeemed to us to be amongſt the Clouds, which a little while after we ſaw below us. At length we came very late to a little Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, which is not yet at the top of the Mountain. It is called <hi>Gruſſe,</hi> that is, the <hi>Salutation;</hi> and it was ſo named becauſe <hi>Charles</hi> V. and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his Brother met in this place: you may find the Story about two hundred Paces from the Village, on a Marble Stone, which was plac'd exactly where theſe two illuſtrious Brothers em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced each other.</p>
                     <p>We had for Supper divers ſorts of Wild-Fowl and Veniſon: almoſt all the Hares
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:45740:71"/>
here, as well as the Foxes and Bears, are white; the Patridges are likewiſe ſo for the moſt part: there are a great many Heath-Hens, Pheaſants, and other great Fowl, which they call <hi>Schenhakn,</hi> or <hi>Cock</hi> of the Snow. All theſe ſort of Wild-Fowl have their Feet velvetted about the Claws, with a kind of Furr, which I cannot call either Hair or Feathers, but ſo thick as the Snow cannot pierce it.</p>
                     <p>The Mountain is called <hi>Brennerberg,</hi> which ſignifies a fiery Hill; and the reaſon is, that beſides the Thunders which are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Summer, there are Winds ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times which pierce and burn. They force themſelves into the Throats or Paſſages of the Neighbouring Mountains, as into Pipes; and theſe various Torrents of the Air ſhock one another ſo impetuouſly, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce roaring and furious Hurricanes, which tear up both Trees and Rocks by the Roots. They ſay, that Travellers are ſometimes conſtrained, to wait many days till theſe Storms are over. As for us, we left this unpleaſant Quarter the next day, and about two hours from thence, came to the higheſt acceſſible part of this Mountain. There we ſaw a thing very remarkable: It was a great Spring which falls upon a Rock, and ſtraightway ſeparates it ſelf into two Currents, which in a little time after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came two conſiderable Rivers. The one turns to the <hi>South,</hi> and diſgorges it ſelf into the <hi>Inn,</hi> near <hi>Inſpruck.</hi> The other runs <hi>Northward,</hi> and after it hath paſſed <hi>Brixen</hi>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:45740:72"/>
and <hi>Bolſane</hi> falls into the <hi>Adige,</hi> a little above <hi>Trent.</hi> We dined the ſame day at <hi>Steert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zingen,</hi> where they gave us Oyſters of <hi>Venice,</hi> and ſome Fleſh of a certain Beaſt call'd <hi>Steinbokt,</hi> which is between a He-Goat and a Doe, and is moſt delicate Food. At this Town we turned out of the direct way to <hi>Trent,</hi> becauſe it is dangerous, by reaſon of the Precipices, and took that of <hi>Brixen,</hi> which is not ſo rough, and is the moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented.</p>
                     <p>This day we met more than an hundred Waggons which came from the Fair of <hi>Bolſane;</hi> they were almoſt all drawn by Oxen. I obſerved that the Cloven Feet of theſe Cattle were both parts ſhod with Iron. The Peaſants of theſe Mountains have little Carts with two Wheels, which they draw themſelves, and which they make uſe of to fetch Salt from <hi>Hall,</hi> which is a little City in the Valley of <hi>Inſpruck.</hi> There are Salt-Pits there, the Water whereof being boiled, turns to Salt.</p>
                     <p>The Habits of theſe Mountaineers are the moſt pleaſant in the World: Some of them have green, others yellow and blue Hats; and in ſome places it is difficult to know the Men from the Women. But as we change Countries, we may in all things obſerve the variety which reigns in the World. We find not only new Languages and new Cuſtoms, but alſo new Plants, new Fruits, new Cattle, and a new Face of the Earth. Almoſt quite throughout <hi>Tirol,</hi> the Sheep are black, in ſome places they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:45740:72"/>
are of a red tawny, and in others altogether white. There are ſome Provinces in which they have Horns; and others, where a horned Sheep would be look'd upon as a Monſter. We obſerved alſo many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in Beaſts of the ſame kind: Nor are the Humours of Men without their Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties. Not to leave the example of the Sheep; I know ſome Provinces, as that of <hi>Poitou,</hi> where the Milk of theſe Creatures is preferred before that of the Cows.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Montague</hi> ſaith, the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> preferr Mares-Milk to all other Milk.</note> In moſt others they will not trouble themſelves to Milk them, ſo little do they value their Milk. I once liv'd a conſiderable while in a Country, where, when a Sow Pigs, if there be any white ones they drown them, becauſe they believe, that all the white Pigs are Meazled. I have been alſo in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Country, where the black Hogs were in leſs eſteem than others. In <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> the Milk of a black Cow is look'd on as a ſpecifick Remedy; the Doctors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it for ſuch, becauſe the black Cows are leſs common than the red. And in ſome places of your Country it is quite contrary, they moſt highly eſteem the red Cows Milk; the cauſe is plain, becauſe the Cows are almoſt all black. Some can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to look on nothing but what they are accuſtom'd to ſee; and others value nothing but what is rare and unknown. Cuſtom and Prejudice domineer over the World, and fantaſtical Humour reigns every where with them.</p>

                     <p>When we entred into the Valley of <hi>Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſane,</hi> we were aſtoniſhed to find the Air as ſweet as could be imagined. The Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards were all green, as well as the Willows, the Roſes, the Mulberies, and a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other Trees. A true Spring in the middle of Winter. This proceeds from its being ſheltred from ill Winds, or from ſome other circumſtance of the Country.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bolſaner</hi> is in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Trent;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">BOLSANE.</note> it is a very little City, and its Fairs are all it can boaſt of. There are four in the Year, and each laſts fifteen days; in which the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed. We obſerved in the Roof of the Body of the great Church, a round Hole about three foot diameter; round about which is a kind of Garland, which is tied
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:45740:75"/>
with Ribbons of ſeveral Colours, and on which I know not how many great Wafers hang. They told us, that on Aſcenſion-day, there was a kind of Opera in this Church, and that a Man which repreſented <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> was lifted up to Heaven through this hole.</p>
                     <p>All the Valley of <hi>Bolſane</hi> is full of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and the Vines are highly eſteem'd by the People of the Country; but Strangers are not pleaſed with them, becauſe of their ſweetiſh Taſte. It is but a good days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney between <hi>Bolſane</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> through the Valley which is very fruitful and pleaſant. From place to place, near the Vines, are little Huts of Straw, which are ſupported by three high Firr-Poles, placed like a Trevet; there they hide themſelves with a Carbine, in one of theſe little Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racques, and kill the Bears which come down from the Mountain to eat the Grapes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">TRENT.</note>
                        <hi>Trent</hi> is a little City, not much bigger than <hi>Bolſane,</hi> and is almoſt ſituated after the ſame manner. It is founded on a flat Rock of a kind of white and reddiſh Marble, of which moſt of the Houſes are ſolidly built. This City hath many times been laid waſte, by the Inundations to which it is ſubject. The River often overflows, and the Brooks of <hi>Levis</hi> and <hi>Ferſena,</hi> tumble ſometimes from the Mountains with ſuch a terrible impetuoſity, that they drive before them great Rocks, and rowl them even into the Town. <hi>Trent</hi> is begirt with a ſingle Wall,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:45740:75"/>
and the <hi>Adige</hi> runs by the ſide of it. They boaſt of the Bridge which is built over this River, without having any thing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to ſhow. They recommended to us the Biſhop's Palace, as a great and ſplendid Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and I remember I have formerly heard the ſame things ſaid of it: But theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports created in us falſe Notions of that Houſe, which is low, and but of a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different ſize. The Biſhop is a Temporal and Spiritual Lord in his Dioceſs, which is of a large extent. Some place it in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> others make it part of <hi>Tirol:</hi> But theſe laſt deceive themſelves, if we may believe the People of the Country, for they ſay <hi>Trent</hi> is in <hi>Italy,</hi> though the Biſhop be a Prince of the Empire; and the common Language of <hi>Trent</hi> is <hi>Italian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They ſhew'd us in a Chapel of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral, the Crucifix <hi>under which the Synod was ſworn, and promulg'd:</hi> It is as big as the Life, and, they ſay, it bowed its Head, to teſtifie the Approbation which it gave to the Decrees of that Aſſembly. They add, That no Man ever knew what it was made of; ſo that many doubt whether it were made with Hands. They are about to take it from the dark Place in which we ſaw it, and place it in a magnificent Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which will ſhortly be finiſhed; where they expect it will do more Miracles than ever: It is call'd by way of Eminency, <hi>The Holy Crucifix.</hi> From thence we went to St. <hi>Mary Major,</hi> which yet is but a little Church. It is built of a kind of baſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:45740:76"/>
whoſe Squares are only cut a little leſs; and it was in this place the Council ſate. The Organs of this Church are extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily great. They played to us many new Ayres, and counterfeited the Cries of a great many Animals: They beat a Drum, and did I know not how many other things, which have little relation to this place, or to the gravity of the Council, which is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in a great Picture hard by.<note place="margin">

They ſay that in the Year 1276, the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtole the Child of a Shooe-maker, whoſe name was <hi>Simon,</hi> and after they had ſhed his Blood in a moſt cruel manner, to ſerve at the Celebration of one of their Feaſts, they threw the Carcaſs into a Water-Pipe (which paſs'd at preſent to the Houſe where the thing was done, and where their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue was at that time), and that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was carried by the Current into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and taken up by Fiſher-men. In a Word, the whole Villany was diſcover'd; the <hi>Jews</hi> were convicted, Thirty nine of them hang'd, and the reſt baniſh'd the City for ever. <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. who was then Pope, being inform'd of the whole matter, thought fit to Canonize the Child, and gave it the name of <hi>Simonin,</hi> the diminitive of <hi>Simon,</hi> the Father's Name. The Body was embalm'd, and is to be ſeen openly in a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45740:76"/>
Caſe which is upon the Altar of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel dedicated to him. They keep alſo in an adjoining Cupboard, the Knife, Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and Four great Iron Needles, with which his Butchers tormented him; and Two Goblets of Silver, in which they drunk his Blood. Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd. But ſome Years after they obtain'd permiſſion to abide in the City Three Days to do Buſineſs, and they aſſur'd me, that theſe Three Days were reduc'd to Three Hours, for their obſtinate Defence of <hi>Buda</hi> in the laſt Siege. They have pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Story at <hi>Francfort,</hi> under the Bridge Gate, to load theſe miſerable People who live in that City, with new Reproach; they have added other infamous Figures, where the Divel and Swine are repreſented mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and laughing at the <hi>Jews.</hi> I forgot to tell you that the little <hi>Simonin</hi> was but Twenty eight Months old when he was thus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr'd.

                        <note place="margin">ROVEREDO.</note>WE paſſed thro' the little City of <hi>Rove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redo,</hi> where there is a great Trade of Silk. <hi>Bourguetto</hi> is not far off, which is the laſt Village of the <hi>Trentin,</hi> and <hi>Oſſenigo</hi> the firſt of the State of <hi>Venice;</hi> a little Croſs of Wood makes the Separation between theſe two Sovereignties. A little on this ſide of <hi>Roveredo,</hi> we travers'd a Country all full of looſe Rocks, ſcatter'd here and there, as if an Earthquake had thus ſow'd them from the Ruines of ſome Mountain: This is call'd the <hi>Wood of Roveredo,</hi> though there be not ſo much as the Branch of a Tree in it. The Paſſage is ſometimes dangerous, by reaſon of Thieves, as well as the Foreſt of <hi>Verg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nara,</hi> which is between <hi>Oſſenigo,</hi> and the Fort of <hi>Guardara.</hi> Our Meſſenger advis'd us to take a Convoy in this laſt Paſſage. When you are come into the States of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> you find no more of thoſe Stoves, of which <hi>Germany</hi> is full; and you find a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible change in every thing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">CHIUSA.</note>We were conſtrain'd to lodge in a little Village call'd <hi>Seraino,</hi> becauſe it was too late to get to <hi>Scluſe.</hi> That is a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Fort, whoſe Situation is ſomething like that of the <hi>Scluſe</hi> which we met be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Geneve</hi> and <hi>Lyons,</hi> on the River <hi>Rhoſne;</hi> I fanſie I have ſeen the Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:45740:77"/>
of it in your Cloſet. The firſt is at the Foot of a high Rock; the way which leads to it is dug out of the craggy part of the ſame Rock; and on the other ſide is a Precipice, at the bottom whereof rowls the <hi>Adige.</hi> After we had paſs'd this Fort, and had for ſome time follow'd the Banks of that River, which glides along among high Rocks, we found the Heaven open'd, and entred into a vaſt Plain; whereas ever ſince our Departure from <hi>Munich,</hi> we had been enclos'd between the Mountains.</p>
                     <p>This Plain is ſtony and barren in divers Places: There are in it ſome Olive-Trees, and White Mulberries for the Silk-Worms; the Vines ate planted at the foot of Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Trees, and young Elms, and they join themſelves in Garlands from Tree to Tree. We paſs'd the <hi>Adige</hi> in a Ferry-Boat, two good Leagues from <hi>Seraino;</hi> and a quarter of an Hour after,<note place="margin">VERONA.</note> we plainly perceiv'd <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona,</hi> where we arrived the ſame Day. By what we ſaw at our entrance into it, we judg'd it to be but thinly Peopled. There are great void places on this ſide, and Graſs growing in the Streets, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of them not paved: It's true, the reſt of the City is not like this part; but putting all together, <hi>Verona</hi> looks like a poor place; and indeed there is but little Trade in it, and thoſe which live on their Rents make no great Figure. If there be ſome fine Buildings, it is certain that the Houſes in general are very low and unequal. The greateſt part of the Balconies are of Wood,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:45740:78"/>
ſo loaded with little Gardens in Pots and Caſes, that it ſeems dangerous to paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them: The Streets are dirty, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all narrow. In a Word, This City is not at all fit to pleaſe the Eyes of a Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. Nevertheleſs it is very great, in a good Air, and its Situation is admirable. As it yields but little ſatisfaction when you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it near, and take a particular view of it; ſo much the more will you admire it, when you look upon it from ſome eminency. We went up to the Caſtle of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which is on a riſing ground, within the Compaſs of the Walls, and we could not give over view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from this Place; where we had a full proſpect of it, and were charm'd to behold that admirable Garden of Pleaſure, in the midſt of which it is ſeated. The <hi>Adige</hi> croſſes it, and Four fair Stone Bridges make the Communication between the two Parts, into which the River divides it. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of St. <hi>Felix</hi> is behind that of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and both together command the City. The other Fortifications of this place are much neglected, and very irregular.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Amphitheatre</hi> of <hi>Verona</hi> is a thing ſo much the more ſurpriſing, becauſe we do not frequently meet with ſuch Monuments of antiquity.<note n="*" place="margin">The outward Wall or Front.</note> The Incloſure is all deſtroy'd, but they have taken care to repair the Benches, according as they fell to decay; there are Four and forty of them, and I counted Five hundred and thirty Paces in the higheſt round, and Two hundred and fifty on the loweſt. Every Step is near a Foot and a

At every end of the <hi>Arena,</hi> between the Benches, there is a Portal of Twenty eight Foot high, by which the Entrance is to the <hi>Arena</hi> out of the Street; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove every Portal a kind of Tribune or Platform of Twenty Foot long, and Ten broad, cloſed before and on the ſides with a Balcony of Marble.<note n="†" place="margin">Others at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute it to the Emperour <hi>Maximin.

                     <p>The Cathedral is a little dark Church. Pope <hi>Lucius</hi> III. is interr'd there; and they have written for an Epitaph on his Tomb-Stone, <hi>Oſſa Lucii</hi> III. <hi>Româ pulſus invidiâ.</hi> I expected to have found another, which is more ingenious, which I remember I have read ſomewhere:

You know this Pope had great Broils with <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa,</hi> as well as <hi>Alexander</hi> III. his Predeceſſor. But theſe were not the only Cauſe of his leaving <hi>Rome:</hi> He was driven out by the Magiſtrates, and by the<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>It is ſaid that <hi>Pepin</hi> the Son of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> and King of <hi>Italy,</hi> built the Church of St. <hi>Zeno</hi> at <hi>Verona.</hi> It muſt be confeſs'd the Carvers of that time were miſerable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts. Never were there ſeen ſuch wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Figures as theſe in the Front of this Church. I obſerv'd in rhe Frontiſpiece of the great Portal, two kind of Birds, which by their Combs ſomewhat reſembled Cocks. They hold an Animal with a long Tail, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, which we ſuſpected was deſign'd to repreſent a Fox; this poor Beaſt had his Feet tied together, and hung over a Pole, the ends of which were ſupported by the Cocks. I cannot forbear ſearching into the meaning of this little Myſtery; and if you pleaſe, I will adventure to tell you my Thoughts of it. The alluſion of <hi>Gallus</hi> a Cock, to <hi>Gallus</hi> a <hi>French</hi>-man, is a thing ſo familiar, that I fanſie the two Cocks may ſignifie two <hi>French</hi>-men, and the Animal thus bound, muſt be ſome crafty Fellow,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:45740:79"/>
cheated nevertheleſs, and ſupplanted by the Cocks. The <hi>Crane</hi> hath formerly been too hard for <hi>Renard.</hi> But to apply this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem to ſome particular Event: Suppoſing it to be true, that this Chuch was built under <hi>Pepin,</hi> as it ſeems very probable, it may be conjectur'd, that his Father <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> and he were the two Cocks, and that the unfortunate <hi>Didier,</hi> the laſt King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> was the Fox: You know <hi>Charlemain</hi> caus'd himſelf to be crown'd King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> after he had diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed <hi>Didier,</hi> and <hi>Pepin</hi> was crown'd King of <hi>Italy</hi> ſome Years after: <hi>Didier</hi> then van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd, ſtripp'd, ſhaven, and put into a Convent; too nearly reſembles the Fox: Except you had rather it ſhould be his Son, whoſe Name, I think, was <hi>Adalgiſe;</hi> who in the end was taken and kill'd, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had vainly employ'd all his Wit and Force to regain the Poſſeſſion of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Dominions. I will not ſay that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin</hi> amus'd himſelf with ſuch a Trifle, but it was perhaps the Fancy of the Carver. On the ſide of the ſame Portal they have put this fine Hieroglyphick. There is a Man on Horſe-back in <hi>baſſo relievo,</hi> over whom theſe Three Verſes are written in Characters, half <hi>Roman,</hi> half <hi>Gothick:</hi>
                        <q>

                     <p>Returning from thence, we paſs'd by the little Church of St. <hi>Mary the Old,</hi> near which are to be ſeen many magnificent Tombs of the <hi>Scaligers,</hi> who, as you know, were Princes of <hi>Verona,</hi> before that City belong'd to the Republick of <hi>Venice.</hi>

                     <p>The Rarities which we ſaw in the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of the Count <hi>Maſcardo,</hi> deſerve that ſome learned Man ſhould undertake their Deſcription: And it may be cauſe of Admiration, that thoſe who have had the Curioſity, and the Means to amaſs ſo many fine things together, ſhould not have had the care to procure Stamps of them, and to add Explanatory Remarks on ſuch as are moſt conſiderable; ſcarce any thing more remarkable can fall within the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Traveller, nor any thing that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves better to be ſtudied and deſcrib'd. There you find a Gallery, and Six Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, all fill'd with the moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Productions of Art or Nature. But as it is not poſſible for me to give you a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Account of ſo many things, ſo will I not engage my ſelf in ſuch a Task, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at preſent, nor for the future: You need but call to mind all that you have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſeen in my Letters, and particularly that which I writ from <hi>Inſpruck.</hi> Of Pictures, Books,<note place="margin">Roman Rods or Faſces.</note> Rings, Animals, Plants, Metals, monſtrous or Extravagant Productions, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:45740:80"/>
Works of all Faſhions; and, in a Word, all that can be imagin'd curious, or worth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, whether for Antiquity or Rarity, or for the Delicacy and Excellency of the Workmanſhip; the Catalogue of them would alone amount to a Volume; only to ſatisfie you in ſome meaſure, I aſſure you, that when-ever I ſhall meet with any thing that I have not taken Notice of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and which ſhall ſeem worthy of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Obſervation, I ſhall take care to communicate it to you.</p>
                     <p>There are here many<note n="*" place="margin">The Veſſels which they name are, <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clabria, pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae, prefericu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, ollae ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pullae.</hi> Many ſorts of Knives, <hi>dola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra, cultri, ſeva, ſeceſpita.</hi> Axes, Mallets, Candleſticks.</note> Inſtruments and Utenſils, which were uſed in the <hi>Pagan</hi> Sacrifices.

                     <p>We ſaw alſo many pieces of Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, fram'd out of the Stone <hi>Amianthos,</hi> which is the <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, ſo famous among the Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts; this Stone, as hard and weighty as it is, is eaſily divided into Fibres or Threads, which are ſo ſtrong and flexible, that they may be ſpun like Cotton. Before I leave this Head, I muſt acquaint you with this Remark concerning the Inſtances of Petrefaction, which I have obſerv'd either here or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; that there is many times a great deal of Errour and Uncertainty in them, and that there are ſeveral Perſons who ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple not to uſe a little Artifice to multiply
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:45740:81"/>
and diverſitie the Rarities with which they deſign to fill a Cabinet. It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd that Nature ſeems to divert herſelf ſometimes, with ſuch fantaſtical Changes; but it muſt alſo be confeſs'd, that they are often counterfeited by Art. I know not whether you ever ſaw any of thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Animals, call'd <hi>Baſilisks,</hi> which have a little reſemblance of a Dragon. The Invention is prettily contriv'd, and has cheated many; for they take a ſmall <hi>Ray,</hi> and having turn'd it after a certain man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and rais'd up the Fins in form of Wings, they fit a little Tongue to it, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped like a Dart, and add Claws and Eyes of Enammel, with other little Knacks, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly order'd; and this is the whole Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy of making Baſilisks. I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that ſome Authors mention another ſort of Baſilisk, without either Feet or Wings, which they repreſent like a crown'd Serpent, and many Naturaliſts affirm that it kills with its Breath and Looks. <hi>Galen</hi> takes notice of it as the moſt Venemous of all Serpents, and tells us that the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel only fears not its Poiſon, but on the contrary, poiſons it with its Breath. But I believe this Serpent is found only in the Land of <hi>Phoenixes</hi> and <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns.</hi>

this Subject. There is a certain natural Production, according to ſome, a kind of imperfect Plant, or a Coralline Matter, which extreamly reſembles a Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room. I know not whether they do not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cheat themſelves, or are willing to cheat others. Be it as it will, this is that which they call <hi>Petrify'd Muſhrooms,</hi> which indeed were never Muſhrooms. The Queſtion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the matter of Fact; but one may yet ſay, that the little ſolidity, and the little hardneſs of a Muſhroom, makes it a thing the leaſt in the World Petrifiable, the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis muſt be done in a trice.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>We ſaw a Burial lately, of which I muſt give you ſome Account: The Body was dreſs'd in Black, with a White Linen Cloak, a fine Peruke, on the Head a Hat, and above that a Garland of Flowers. The Corps was laid on a Quilt, with a Counterpane of Flower'd Silk, Yellow and Red, and ſupported with a Pillow of the ſame Stuff. Four Men carry'd it thus all open, and the Company follow'd Two and Two, of which only thoſe wore Garlands who were never Married. This was alſo the Cuſtom of the Ancients, and they call'd it <hi>Corona pudicitiae,</hi> The Crown of Chaſtity. Some Hours before, we had another Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter: It was a Woman richly dreſs'd, who walk'd thro' the City between two Nuns, and was going to take the Habit. It is ordinary in this Country to go thus in publick, whereas in <hi>France,</hi> and many other places, this Ceremony is perform'd in the Convent.<note place="margin">M.

He-Aſs, which he made uſe of to ride on, being willing that the Beaſt ſhould paſs the reſt of his days in quiet and liberty. They add, that the Aſs, weary with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo long gnaw'd on the Paſtures of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> reſolv'd to viſit foreign Countries, and to undertake a Voyage by Sea; he had no need, ſay they, of a Ship, the Waves became ſmooth, and the liquid Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as hard as Cryſtal. After he had viſited the Iſlands of <hi>Cyprus, Rhodes, Candie, Malta,</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> he paſs'd over the Gulf of <hi>Venice,</hi> and ſtaid ſome days in the place where that famous City was ſince built: But the Air ſeeming to him to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthful, and the Paſturage bad among the Salt and Mariſh Iſles, <hi>Martin</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd his Voyage, and mounted the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Adige</hi> dry-ſhod, and coming up to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona,</hi> he made choice of that for his laſt Reſidence. After he had liv'd there ſome Years, like an Aſs of Eſtate and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he died at laſt, to the great Grief of the Con-fraternity. So lamentable and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal a Braying, made the Echoes reſound thro' the Country, and never was ſo ſad a Melody heard at the Funeral of ſuch an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal, not even in <hi>Arcadia</hi> it ſelf. But they quickly found a way to alleviate their Grief, for all the Honours imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble being render'd to the bleſt Deceas'd, the Devotees of <hi>Verona</hi> carefully preſerve the Reliques, and have put them into the Belly of an Artificial Aſs, made for that purpoſe, where they are kept to this day,

                     <p>THE Country between <hi>Verona</hi> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenza</hi> is fruitful, well manur'd, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every where level: The Trees are planted in Chequers, on which the Vines are rais'd, and ſpread themſelves among the Branches; and the Ground is carefully till'd. We din'd at a little Village call'd <hi>La Torre,</hi> where are the Bounds between the <hi>Veroneſe</hi> and <hi>Vicentin.</hi> The Wine of this Country is of ſo faint a Sweetneſs, that it is noxious to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:45740:83"/>
the Stomach. Yet there are Wines at <hi>Verona</hi> that are much eſteem'd, and I think I have read in <hi>Suetonius,</hi> that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> made them his ordinary Drink. The Bread is as if it were Earth, tho' very white and excellent Flower; it is becauſe they know not how to make it: Together with this, they treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with a Diſh of grey Peaſe, fried in Oil, and this was all our Feaſt. Is it not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange that we ſhould be in danger to die of Hunger in a good Country, after we had fed plentifully among the Rocks and Mountains? The Soil is fat, and conſequently the Ways bad; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that at this Seaſon, there was need of Seven or Eight Horſes to draw the Waggon-Coaches; they put them all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether under the Coachman's Whip, that he may drive them without a Poſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vicenza</hi> is leſs by half than <hi>Verona,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">VICENZA.</note> and is only encompaſs'd with tottering Walls. Three or Four little Rivers meet there, by which divers Commodities are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, but none of them are Navigable. Our Guide carried us to ſome of the Churches: The <hi>Coronata</hi> is well paved and wainſcotted: That of the Religious of St. <hi>Catharines,</hi> hath Three fair Altars. There are ſome good Pictures in the Cathedral; and they ſhow us, likewiſe, in the Choir a Work of carv'd Stones, which the Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton prais'd very much, tho' the matter be of little value; the Performance is better than the Deſign. The Town-Houſe is
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:45740:84"/>
very indifferent, yet they boaſt of it as a rare Piece. For to tell you the truth, it is a difficult matter to accommodate one's ſelf to the high-flown Diſcourſes of the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians.</hi> It is impoſſible for them to ſpeak modeſtly; for when they would praiſe any thing, they do it with exaggerations; and he who hath the good fortune to pleaſe them, is always <hi>Wonderfull, Marvelous,</hi> and <hi>Incomparable.</hi> We have already ſeen I know not how many pretended Eighth Wonders of the World. When we complain'd that we ſaw at <hi>Verona,</hi> ſo few conſiderable Buildings in ſo great a City, and which had formerly been ſo famous; they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us that we ſhould find Mountains and Miracles at <hi>Vicenza.</hi> They told us <hi>Vicenza</hi> was full of ſtately Palaces, of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſumptuous Architecture. Theſe were indeed big Words; but 'tis certain that never any found themſelves more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed than we were when we came to ſee theſe pretended magnificent Palaces of <hi>Vicenza;</hi> for we muſt uſe the Phraſes of the <hi>Italians,</hi> who muſt be allow'd to call what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they pleaſe, a <hi>Palace.</hi> A little Citizen's Hall, which you in <hi>England</hi> call a <hi>Parlour,</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> hath the Title of <hi>The Chamber of Audience,</hi> when you may as well give the Title of <hi>Embaſſies</hi> to a Footboy's Meſſage. It is all one to me, whether they call the Lacqueys <hi>Embaſſadors,</hi> or all their Houſes <hi>L'Ouvres.</hi> This is the beſt in the World in <hi>Italian;</hi> but for us, or others, who are no <hi>Italians,</hi> we cannot ſuffer our ſelves to be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:45740:84"/>
ſurprized with their <hi>Palaces,</hi> nor their moſt <hi>Sumptuous.</hi> I know not very well what the Word <hi>Palace</hi> ſignifies in your Tongue; but thoſe who are ſomewhat verſed in our Language, ought to have no regard to the reſemblance of the Word <hi>Palais,</hi> to that of <hi>Palazzo,</hi> as if they ſignified the ſame thing. The Word <hi>Palais</hi> is not uſed ſo prodigally amongſt us, as that of <hi>Palazzo</hi> is amongſt the <hi>Italians;</hi> it imports a great deal more, and excites another <hi>Idea</hi> in the Hearer. In a Word, I find that they give the Name of <hi>Palazzi</hi> to an infinite Number of ordinary Houſes, to which that of <hi>Palais</hi> does not at all belong. And to apply all that has been ſaid to the lofty Palaces of <hi>Vicenza.</hi> I maintain in general, that they may be call'd handſome Houſes, and no more. Perhaps there are Three or Four for which that Name might ſeem too mean; but I cannot tell how they can be term'd <hi>very fine;</hi> for to ſpeak properly, they are but well-diſguis'd, not fine Houſes: That is to ſay, there is nothing fair but the Frontiſpiece, and that is no more than indifferent, for they are often built with Plaiſter inſtead of hewn Stone. I inſiſt the more on this, becauſe it is hard to root out the old Miſtake, with which many People are poſſeſs'd, about the multitude of Palaces in <hi>Italy;</hi> and I would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour always to repreſent things as they are.</p>
                     <p>Our Guide finding that we were no great Admirers of his Palaces, fanſi'd however,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:45740:85"/>
that he knew a way to ſurprize us; and having inſenſibly oblig'd us to follow him, he drew us on through the Dirt, a good half League from the City, to ſhew us a little Country-Houſe, which belonged to the Marqueſs of <hi>Capra.</hi> It is a ſquare Building, in the midſt whereof is a little Hall, under a ſmall Dome, and at each Angle of the ſquare two Chambers and a Cloſet. There are ſome good Pictures in it; and the ſituation being on a little aſcent, contributes to render the place very agreeable.</p>
                     <p>Coming back from this Houſe, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd us to our Lady of <hi>Montheric.</hi> It is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in this Country, and the Prior told us the whole Story of it very ſeriouſly. You are to know only that this Image of our Lady came out of the Earth, in the very place where you ſee her: And that they have often in vain endeavoured to tranſport her to <hi>Vicenza;</hi> Ten thouſand Men together, as the Prior told us, were not able to carry her. The Picture by <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Verona,</hi> which is in their Dining-Room, is the beſt Piece in the Convent, it repreſents St. <hi>Gregory</hi> at Table with ſome Pilgrims.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome Ruines of an ancient Amphitheatre at <hi>Vicenza,</hi> but they told us, they were almoſt all hid under new Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. The Theatre which is in the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy of the Olympicks, is of the famous <hi>Palladio.</hi> The Fabrick is none of the largeſt, and they uſe it but on certain occaſions, which rarely happen. The Triumphal-Arch,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:45740:85"/>
which is without the Gates, at the entrance of the Plain, which is called the <hi>Field of Mars,</hi> is in imitation of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick way of Building, by the ſame <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Garden of the Count of <hi>Valmanara,</hi> is a thing much boaſted of in this City, and the Inſcription which we read over the Garden-Gate, put us in great expectations. You have here the Contents of it:
<q>Stop, dear Traveller, thou, who ſearcheſt for rare things, and enchanted places, for here thou mayſt find ſatisfaction. Enter into this deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Garden, and taſte abundantly of all ſorts of Pleaſures: The Count of <hi>Valmanara</hi> gives thee leave, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
In effect, they once deſign'd to have made this a very agreeable place. There is a Canal, Diviſions or Knots, and Cloſets; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides an Alley of Citrons and Oranges, which is indeed a fine thing.</p>
                     <p>This Mounſieur the Count puts me in mind of a pleaſant Story, which I have read in ſeveral Authors. They ſay that <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth being at <hi>Vicenza,</hi> a great number of Gentlemen and rich Burgeſſes of that place, preſſed him very much to grant them the Title of Counts: <hi>Charles</hi> ſtill drew back, but in the end, to be rid of theſe troubleſome People, ſaid aloud, <hi>Well, well, I make you all Counts, both the City and Suburbs.</hi> From this time, ſaith the Hiſtory,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:45740:86"/>
nothing is more common than the Counts of <hi>Vicenza.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The way from <hi>Vicenza</hi> to <hi>Padua</hi> is not unlike to that between <hi>Verona</hi> and <hi>Vicenza.</hi> We paſſed the <hi>Tezenza</hi> about three quarters of an hour from <hi>Vicenza,</hi> and the <hi>Brenta</hi> an hour from <hi>Padua.</hi> I know not whether the Antiquaries are agreed concerning this <hi>Brenta:</hi> Some pretend it was the <hi>Timavus,</hi> and others, that it is one of the <hi>Medoacus</hi>'s: The firſt opinion ſeems leaſt probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the River <hi>Timavus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Bologna la graſſa venetia la guaſta, ma Padoa la Paſſa.</note> which paſſeth by <hi>Friuli,</hi> and which is apparently the true one; but let us leave them to end their difference, and come to <hi>Padua.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Paduan</hi> is a level Country, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly fruitful, yet <hi>Padua</hi> is a poor and ill-peopled City. The Circuit of it is great: but there are large places in it that are void of Buildings, and many Houſes void of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>PADUA,</hi> called the Learned. This City was ſubjected to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> in the Year <hi>1406.</hi> In <hi>1519.</hi> they pulled down the Suburbs, in which were <hi>10</hi> Monaſteries, <hi>6</hi> Churches, <hi>7</hi> Hoſpitals, and about <hi>3000</hi> Houſes. <hi>Schrad.</hi>
                        </note> The ancient <hi>Padua</hi> hath ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd its firſt Walls; but ſince it fell into the hands of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the Suburbs in the City, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed it with a Fortification, which was never good, and is at preſent ready to fall.</p>
                     <p>There are Porches or Piazza's, almoſt throughout the whole City, which are very convenient to ſhelter People from Rain, but otherwiſe make the Streets narrow and dark, and give opportunity for thoſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:45740:86"/>
Robberies and Murders, which they call at <hi>Padua,</hi> the <hi>Qui va li?</hi> What can be more ſtrange, than that the Scholars of <hi>Padua,</hi> ſhould be priviledg'd to knock down thoſe whom they meet, and to break Legs and Arms, without any hope of Juſtice? For, as ſoon as Night falls, they arm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and going out in Companies, hide themſelves between the Pillars of the Porches; and while the poor Paſſenger is ſtruck with terror at the hearing of the Queſtion, <hi>Qui va li?</hi> without perceiving who makes it; another at the ſame time cries, <hi>Qui va la?</hi> without giving a Man an opportunity to go forward or backward; the unhappy Creature muſt periſh between the <hi>Qui va li,</hi> and the <hi>Qui va la:</hi> of which theſe Sparks make but a Sport. This is what they call the <hi>Qui va li</hi> of <hi>Padua.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It often happens that theſe Scholars kill unknown Perſons, or ſome of themſelves, to maintain the privilege that they have aſſum'd. 'Tis true, theſe Indignities are not daily committed, for People keep themſelves as cloſe as they can out of harms way. But it may be ſaid, without exaggeration, that not a Month paſſeth, in which two or three Miſchances do not happen. Not but that this unbridled Licence might be eaſily reſtrain'd; but <hi>Venice,</hi> which inſiſts on the fineneſs of her Politicks, and puſhes them to the utmoſt, would have this Scourge for the <hi>Paduans,</hi> and this Petrolle which coſts nothing. I will tell you the reſt another time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="134" facs="tcp:45740:87"/>I had yeſterday a long diſcourſe with ſome Perſons, who believe that <hi>Padua</hi> was formerly a Sea-Port, both becauſe the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients ſpeak of it, as a very rich Place, and becauſe when they dig Wells or Foundations of Houſes, they find in divers places Anchors and Maſts. I know not if this Opinion may ſeem reaſonable to you; but ſince Hiſtory hath given us no account of it, I ſhould rather have recourſe to a more eaſie way, to explain how Veſſels come up to <hi>Padua,</hi> which is, that there was formerly ſome great Canal.</p>
                     <p>They affirm alſo, that <hi>Padua</hi> was built by <hi>Antenor,</hi> and they ſhow there a great repoſitory for Bones, in which they have placed the pretended Bones of this old <hi>Trojan,</hi> and it is commonly called <hi>Antenor</hi>'s Tomb. But this Tradition is not very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: it cannot indeed be denied, that<note n="*" place="margin">See the 1ſt Book of the <hi>Eneids.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenor</hi> came into this Country: And 'tis no leſs certain, that he built a City which was called <hi>Patavium.</hi> But the queſtion is whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our <hi>Padua</hi> be the <hi>Patavium</hi> of <hi>Antenor,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Meſſala Corvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſaith, that the Arms of <hi>Troy</hi> were placed by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenor</hi> in the Temple of <hi>Padua;</hi> and that they were a <hi>Sow</hi> in a <hi>Field Or.</hi>
                        </note> for this Opinion is not improbable, yet there are Arguments againſt it, as well as for it.</p>
                     <p>As for the Tomb it is a meer Bauble. It is about four hundred and odd Years, that they were working on the Foundations of an Hoſpital, and dug up a Leaden-Coffin, near which they found a Sword. The
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:45740:87"/>
Coffin had no Inſcription, and upon the Sword were ſome <hi>Leonin</hi> Verſes of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Latin.</hi> Judge, I pray you, whether this may not as well agree with the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe as <hi>Antenor.</hi> In the mean time the immoderate love which ſome People have for every thing that bears the Stamp of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, has made ſome Perſons dream, that they had found the Tomb of <hi>Antenor.</hi> A certain Man called <hi>Lupatus,</hi> who was then Magiſtrate, and a Man of ſome Learning, had alſo his Reaſons or Prejudices in favour of theſe Bones: And he it was, who ſome Years after, put them in that renowned Tomb, which they call at this day the Tomb of <hi>Antenor,</hi> and which is to be ſeen at the entrance of St. <hi>Laurence</hi>'s-ſtreet. He cauſed four Verſes to be Engraved on it, and which, as you may believe are in <hi>Gothick</hi> Characters:

                        </q>
There are ſome who read, <hi>Patriae vox,</hi> and others, <hi>Patriam.</hi> But they are both in the wrong, for the <hi>ae</hi> of the word <hi>Patriae</hi> is plain; and if one would joyn the <hi>m,</hi> which follows with <hi>Patriae,</hi> it muſt be read <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triaem.</hi> This <hi>m</hi> is nearer to <hi>vox</hi> than <hi>Patriae,</hi> nor can it be doubted to be an <hi>m,</hi> becauſe the ſame Character is found in divers words which follow. I confeſs that <hi>Muox</hi> ſignifies
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:45740:88"/>
nothing no more thin <hi>Patriaem;</hi> and turn theſe Verſes which way you pleaſe, you will never find any good ſence.</p>
                     <p>To conclude the account of this Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there are ſome who have made a falſe Remark upon the word <hi>caeſa,</hi> as if it were writ with a ſingle <hi>e,</hi> but they have not obſerved the<note n="*" place="margin">ae</note> eciril, which ſerves for an <hi>ae;</hi> beſides, there are, you know, old Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which never regard this Dipthong. <hi>Enetum</hi> is written without an <hi>h,</hi> and there is no punctuation obſerv'd throughout. I know not what to ſay of the <hi>C.</hi> which is put to the beginning of the Verſe. You muſt further know, that Doctor <hi>Lupetus</hi> would have his own Tomb placed near that of his dear <hi>Antenor,</hi> and they remain at preſent ſide by ſide.</p>
                     <p>The Church of St.<note n="*" place="margin">They call him St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> of <hi>Padua,</hi> becauſe he died there, and was there buried, but he was a <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcan</hi> of <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with St. <hi>Francis d'Aſſiſe.

                        <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> is very great, and full of fine things, as well in Carving as in Painting. There are many magnificent Tombs in it, among which we obſerv'd<note n="†" place="margin">Made in the Year <hi>1555.</hi> by <hi>Auguſtin Zotto.</hi>

There cannot be ſeen a fairer Picture in <hi>Freſco,</hi> than that of the Chapel of St. <hi>Felix,</hi> it was done by the famous <hi>Giotto,</hi> who excelled in that ſort of work.

this Church is the<note n="†" place="margin">Forty foot long, and twenty five broad. <hi>Ang. Port.</hi>
                        </note> Chapel of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> the great Protector of <hi>Padua,</hi> whom, by way of eminency they call the Saint. His Body lies under the Altar, which is inriched with a thouſand precious things. They ſay that the Bones of the Saint caſt forth a very ſweet Odour; thoſe who have the Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſmell them, go behind the Altar to a certain part which is not well joyned, and where it were eaſie to thruſt in ſome Balſam, or ſuch like odoriferous thing. All the Chapel is covered with a <hi>Baſſo relievo</hi> Work of white Marble, in which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the principal Miracles of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony.</hi> Almoſt the whole work was done by <hi>Tullius Lombardus,</hi> and <hi>Sanſovin.</hi> There are alſo ſix and thirty great ſilver Lamps, which burn Night and Day round the Altar: I will not trouble you with that medley of Stories, which thoſe who ſhew this Chapel, are wont to relate concerning their Saint.</p>
                     <p>From this Church we went to that of St. <hi>Juſtina,</hi> which is very great and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, though it be far from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to which they deſign to advance it. It is pav'd with Marble-ſquares, of red, black, and white; the Roof of the great Body of the Church hath ſeven Domes, which give it both Light and Ornament. There are alſo two on each Arm of the Croſs. Beſides the great Altar, which is a ſtately Work, there are twenty four others of fine Marble, and all different in Colour. And whereas the Church of St. <hi>Anthony</hi> is full of Monuments, they will

not ſuffer any in this: There is only one Inſcription, which ſays, That the Church was built at the only charge of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.

                     <p>I will not undertake to give you a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular deſcription of this Church.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:45740:89"/>
are to be ſeen in it many Monuments which have been erected for illuſtrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. <hi>Padua</hi> had a happy chance to redeem its Founder out of the obſcurity in which he had lain for near three thouſand Years: It was but juſt alſo, that the firſt unknown Tomb they met withal in this City, ſhould ſerve to honour the Memory of <hi>Titus Livi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> the famous Hiſtorian who was born there.</p>
                     <p>The diſcovery of this Tomb, in the Year 1413. was attended with the univerſal joy and acclamations of the People. There was found in the Gardens of St. <hi>Juſtina,</hi> a ſhrine of Lead, not unlike to that of <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor;</hi> and they preſently concluded, that it was the Coffin of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> becauſe that Hiſtorian was the Prieſt of Concord; and the Convent of the <hi>Benedictines</hi> of St. <hi>Juſtina,</hi> is built on the Ruines of a Temple, which was of old Conſecrated to that Goddeſs. When the noiſe of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery was ſpread abroad, all the City run thither, with tranſports of an inexpreſſible Joy and Zeal. The People touched their Beads on the Shrine of the ſuppoſed <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> as if he had been ſome new Saint. Many private Perſons offered to be at the Charge of a <hi>Mauſolaeum,</hi> provided they might erect it in their own Houſes; and every one rejoyc'd that he was born in that happy Age, when this precious Treaſure was diſcovered. In fine, <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> after he had been robb'd of his Jaws by a People greedy of Relicks, was put into a Coffin of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:45740:90"/>
Wood, that he might more eaſily be carried. They loaded it with Branches of Laurel, and the beſt of the City carried it in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to the Palace of Juſtice; in which place, after many Deliberations and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, they erected the Monument which is now to be ſeen, and to which they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward added this Inſcription, which was found in the Neighbourhood of the place where the Temple of Concord formerly ſtood.</p>

Some have exalted <hi>Suſanna</hi> beyond <hi>Lucretia,</hi> but it may be juſtly ſaid that the Marchioneſs <hi>D' Obizzi,</hi> of whom I ſhall preſently ſpeak, hath ſurpaſſed <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna</hi> and <hi>Lucretia</hi> both; ſince when ſhe ſaw Death preſent before her, ſhe reſolv'd to bear it couragiouſly, rather than to ſuffer her Chaſtity to be Injur'd. A Gentleman of <hi>Padua,</hi> was paſſionately in love with this Lady, who was young and beautiful, and found an opportunity to get into her Chamber when ſhe was in Bed, in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Marqueſs her Husband. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the Gentleman firſt uſed all the ways of ſweetneſs and perſwaſion, before he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to acts of Violence. But however, when he ſaw he could prevail neither way, his Love turned to Fury, and Rage ſo tranſported him, that he ſtabbed this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Lady. See the Inſcription:</p>

                     <p>When the Marchioneſs was ſurprized in her Bed, her only Son, about five Years old was with her; but the Murtherer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving carried him into a Neighbouring Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, before he perpetrated his horrid Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, the Child could not ſee all that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The thing being brought to light, the Gentleman was taken into Cuſtody, upon ſuſpicion: It was known that he had an Inclination to the Marchioneſs. The Child gave ſome Information; ſome Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours affirm'd, they had ſeen the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in that Quarter: They found a Button of his Sleeve on the Bed, fellow to that which he ſtill wore; and theſe things were ſtrong Arguments of his Guilt. They put him to the Torture, both ordinary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, but he ſtill denied the Fact; and after fifteen Years Impriſonment, his Friends wrought ſo hard, that they ſaved him, and even, as I ſuppoſe, obtained his Liberty; which yet he enjoyed not long, for ſome Months after his Deliverance, the young Marqueſs, which was the Child I ſpoke of, ſhot him with a Piſtol in the Head, and ſo revenged the Death of his Mother. He is at preſent in <hi>Germany,</hi> in the Emperor's Service.</p>

                     <p>IT was an extraordinary ſatisfaction to me to meet with your Letters in this place; beſides the pleaſure I had to learn
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:45740:92"/>
good news of you; you have done me a ſingular kindneſs, in propoſing Queſtions to me, about thoſe things concerning which you deſire to be moſt particularly inform'd. Aſſure your ſelf, Sir, my beſt endeavours ſhall not be wanting to anſwer your Demands exactly: I entreat you to continue the ſame Method hereafter, that I may be better enabl'd to ſend you ſuch Accounts as may be acceptable to your ſelf, and thoſe of our Friends, to whom you communicate them.</p>
                     <p>You deſire me to tell you ſincerely, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our preſent Travels be really pleaſant to us, or at leaſt whether the pleaſure we take in them be not over-balanced by the trouble which they give us. I am not at all ſurpriſed that you ſhould entertain ſuch a doubt of it; for though we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Wild Bears, or in the Deſarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> yet are we not without ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. The Weather is very rough; the way of Travelling ordinarily unpleaſant, and the days ſo ſhort, that we get late in at Night, and riſe very early: We oftentimes meet with hard Lodging, and worſe Diet; and beſides, we are expoſed to many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Nevertheleſs, with a good Stock of Health, Money, Chearfulneſs and Patience, we have ſurmounted theſe difficulties, even almoſt without taking notice of them. Cuſtom makes all things eaſie, and is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign and univerſal Remedy. We take ſome days of reſt when we think we want it: The variety and perpetual Novelty of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:45740:92"/>
Objects recreates the Spirits as well as the Eyes. A little wearineſs ſupplies the want of a Bed, and Exerciſe ſharpens our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites. <hi>Offa &amp; torus herbaceus, famis &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boris dulciſſimae medullae ſunt.</hi> With good Furrs we defended our ſelves againſt the Cold, in ſpite of all the Froſts and Snows of the <hi>Alps:</hi> In fine, without alledging thoſe general Reaſons, which render Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels profitable and pleaſant, I will poſitively tell you, that the tendereſt and moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Perſons of our Company, have eaſily overcome all thoſe Obſtacles, which might hinder the ſatisfaction which we expected. Our ſtay at <hi>Venice</hi> will perfectly recruit us, and when we ſhall proceed on our Travels, the ſweetneſs of the Spring will inſenſibly begin to ſucceed the rigours of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>As to the reſt, I have let a whole Month paſs without writing to you, ſince we arrived in this City, that I might more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly inform my ſelf of the things with which I intend to entertain you. I will tell you nothing but what I have ſeen my ſelf, or of which I have had particular Information. You are in the right to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that I will not undertake to give you a deſcription of <hi>Venice;</hi> that would be a work too tedious, and foreign to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Yet I will not affect to tell you only ſuch new and ſingular things as were never mention'd by any other. Being willing to be ignorant what others have written; I will ſpeak as an Eye-witneſs, and repreſent
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:45740:93"/>
to you, as naturally as I can, the principal part of ſuch things as I ſhall judge worthy of obſervation, without giving any heed to what others have ſaid. You will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that I take care throughout to anſwer your particular Queſtions: If you have forgotten any thing, you may acquaint me with it in your next Letters. <hi>Venice</hi> is ſo ſingular a place, look on it which way you pleaſe, that I have propoſed to my ſelf to conſider it with care: I have filled all my Memorials; and I hope I ſhall be able to give a ſatisfactory anſwer to moſt of your Queſtions. But I muſt advertiſe you of two things, before I put an end to this little Preface. The firſt is, that I reſerve ſome of the moſt notable Obſervations, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to you on ſome other occaſion. The other is, that I will not oblige my ſelf to any order in my Obſervations, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late things as I chanc'd to meet with them, as I have already intimated to you in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place.</p>
                     <p>We parted from <hi>Padua</hi> on the twentieth of the laſt Month, and came hither betimes that Evening: There are many good Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages on the way, and a great many Houſes of Pleaſure, which belong to noble <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and were built by <hi>Palladio.</hi> The <hi>Ausbourg</hi>-Poſt brought us to <hi>Meſtré,</hi> which is a little City on the Bank of the <hi>Gulf,</hi> Five Miles from <hi>Venice.</hi> I have read ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in <hi>Mezeray</hi>'s Hiſtory, that the <hi>Adriatick</hi>-Sea was frozen in the Year<note n="*" place="margin">Others ſay in <hi>859.</hi>
                        </note> 860, and that they went in a Coach from the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:45740:93"/>
main Land to <hi>Venice.</hi> As for us, we were oblig'd to take <hi>Gondola's</hi> at <hi>Meſtré,</hi> and were about an Hour and an half on the Water.</p>
                     <p>That I may give you a true <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>VENICE,</hi> call'd the Rich.</note> I muſt in the firſt place deſcribe thoſe Waters in the midſt of which it is ſeated. The general Opinion of Geographers is, That <hi>Venice</hi> is built in the Sea, and this in ſome meaſure is true; nevertheleſs it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Explication: It is certain it is not the Main Sea, but drown'd Lands, yet ſuch as were drown'd before the Building of <hi>Venice;</hi> that is, at the leaſt Thirteen or Fourteen Hundred Years ago. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Veſſels float in ſome places on thoſe Waters, and there are Chanels by which thoſe that are of no greater Burden than Two Hundred Tuns, can go up to <hi>Venice</hi> it ſelf. The Sea there hath a free Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the Main Sea, by the Ebbing and Flowing Tides. The Oyſters and other Shell-Fiſh ſtick to the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Houſes of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Murano,</hi> as they do in other places to the Rocks; ſo that I think it may be truly ſaid, that <hi>Venice</hi> is in the Sea. Yet ſince 'tis plain that this drown'd Country was formerly a Mariſh; theſe Waters have but very little depth, and after all, this is not the true and ancient Sea: This Extent of Water is at <hi>Venice</hi> call'd only the Lake or Mariſh, and they gave it the Name of <hi>Lacuna;</hi> I obſerve that the greateſt part of Strangers adopt this Word, every one diſguiſing
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:45740:94"/>
it according to his own Language, for want of a fit term to expreſs it. <hi>Lacune</hi> hath another ſignification in <hi>French,</hi> which perhaps is the reaſon that they change here the C into G and call it <hi>Lagune.</hi> Tho' this be a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Word, and newly invented, yet I am reſolv'd to make uſe of it, ſuch as it is, rather than give my ſelf the trouble to frame a better.</p>
                     <p>They have Mills, and other Machines, to empty the Mud and Ouſe, which ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continually, and diſcover themſelves in ſeveral places, when the Sea is at the loweſt Ebb: They have turn'd the Mouth of the <hi>Brent,</hi> and ſome other Rivers, to prevent their throwing of Mud and Sand into the <hi>Lagunes;</hi> and that the Earth may not regain from the Sea, which would be very prejudicial to <hi>Venice,</hi> whoſe Strength and Security conſiſts in its Situation. It is true, that if this City is oblig'd to labour inceſſantly, to keep the Waters which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron it at a certain depth, to prevent its being re-united to the Continent; ſo it would not be for its advantage in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that theſe Waters ſhould have a great and general depth; becauſe while things remain in or near the ſame Poſture they are now in, it, is, in a manner, impoſſible to approach to <hi>Venice,</hi> either by Sea or Land. When <hi>Pepin,</hi> of whom we ſpake not long ſince, undertook to expel the Doge <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,</hi> and his Son <hi>John,</hi> who was his Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate. He parted from <hi>Ravenna</hi> with his Fleet, imagining with full Sails, to paſs
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:45740:94"/>
every-where. But whilſt the Doge's Ships ſteer'd their Courſe through the navigable Chanels, without meeting with any Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, <hi>Pepin</hi>'s Veſſels ſtuck, and ſunk in the Mud on all ſides; ſo that after a great loſs, he was conſtrain'd to fly with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of his wreck'd Fleet. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that could this Fleet have paſſed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where with full Sails, this Expedition had ſucceeded better. It is about Three hundred and odd Years ſince the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> receiv'd the like treatment.</p>
                     <p>I believe you do by this time ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehend what is meant by theſe <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunes</hi> of <hi>Venice:</hi> Repreſent then alſo to your ſelf the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> which riſes out of the midſt of theſe Waters, with Thirty or Forty large Steeples, and is at leaſt a League and an a half diſtant from the Land. It is certainly a very ſurpriſing Object to ſee this great City without any Walls, or Ramparts, to be beaten on every ſide with the Waves, and yet to remain on its Piles as firm as on a Rock.</p>
                     <p>I know very well that all Geographers have written, that <hi>Venice</hi> is compos'd of Seventy two Iſles; I will not controvert ſo generally receiv'd an Opinion: But I muſt confeſs, that I can by no means conceive what theſe Iſles ſhould be; and I dare aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that this Account gives a falſe Notion of the Platform and Situation of this City. It would ſeem by this Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, that there were Seventy two little Hills, one near the other, and that theſe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:45740:95"/>
little Eminencies being all inhabited, had at laſt form'd the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> which is not at all probable. <hi>Venice</hi> is all flat, and built on Piles in the Water. The Water waſhes the Foundations of almoſt all the Houſes, to the height of Four or Five Feet, and the Canals are always of equal breadth. 'Tis true, they have made the beſt uſe of ſeveral ſpaces, of a reaſonable bigneſs, which may, indeed, give occaſion to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that there was formerly ſome Land there, but not Seventy two Iſles.</p>
                     <p>For the Streets, they are very narrow, and ſeem to have been fill'd and rais'd with Mud and Rubbiſh; for it is not at all probable that they have natural Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and beſides, if all the Diviſions which the Canals make, were reckon'd for Iſles, we ſhould find near Two hundred inſtead of Seventy two. It might be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerv'd, that the number of theſe Iſles might be infinitely increas'd, and new ones made in any place, by fixing Poles, and building Houſes upon them. There are Eighteen, or Twenty ſuch like Iſlands ſcatter'd up and down in the <hi>Lagunes,</hi> without counting <hi>Paleſtrina, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malocco,</hi> and Eight or Ten others, which conſiſt of ſolid Earth, and are truly Iſles.</p>
                     <p>We are not to take notice of what is commonly ſaid of the greatneſs of <hi>Venice;</hi> ſome give it Eight Miles circuit, others allow but Seven. As for me, I aſſure you <hi>Venice</hi> is neither Eight nor Seven Miles in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:45740:95"/>
compaſs. They reckon Five Miles from <hi>Meſtré</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> which way we came in an Hour and an half, with Two Rowers; and we ſail'd round <hi>Venice</hi> in the ſame ſpace of time, with Two other Rowers, who made neither more nor leſs haſte than thoſe of <hi>Meſtré.</hi> Judge then by this, of the Circuit of that City: Conſider too, that our <hi>Gondola,</hi> was many times obliged to fetch a Compaſs, to avoid the little Capes which the City makes in ſeveral places, and by conſequence the Line that it made was greater than the true Circuit of the City. Beſides, to mark the Circumference of a City, without conſidering its Figure, is not a competent way to determine the largeneſs of its Content.<note place="margin">This is what made <hi>Polybi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> ſay, That <hi>Sparta,</hi> which had but Forty eight <hi>Stades</hi> in compaſs, was twice as big as <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> which had Fifty. [A <hi>Stade</hi> contain'd <hi>125</hi> Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Paces.]</note> A very indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Mathematician may demonſtrate clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that a City which is near Eight Miles in compaſs, for Example, may contain a leſs number of Houſes, than another City which is only Four Miles, or leſs if you pleaſe. This depends upon the regularity or irregularity of the Figure. This Truth, which is undeniable, is the reaſon that I never will never pretend to repreſent the bigneſs of Cities by the meaſure of their Circuit, for that might betray you into ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable Errors. I ſhall ordinarily content my ſelf with telling you, that a City is Great, or very Great; Little, or very Little: And I am perſuaded that ſuch Expreſſions as theſe, may give you a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Idea</hi> of its Greatneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="152" facs="tcp:45740:96"/>The number of Inhabitants is another thing which is haſtily determined, but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom well examin'd. It is commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported at <hi>Venice,</hi> that there are Two or three hundred thouſand Souls in the City, and ſome have advanc'd the number to Four hundred thouſand; but we muſt not rely upon theſe Computations. When the Trade of <hi>Venice</hi> flouriſh'd, 'tis probable that the number of its Inhabitants was much greater than it is at preſent: But if we may give credit to the Report of a Perſon who hath been ſettled here for a long time, and aſſur'd me, that his Calculation is very exact; <hi>Venice</hi> doth not at preſent contain more than an Hundred and forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Souls, comprehending therein the Iſle of <hi>Giudeca.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe who pleaſe themſelves to repreſent <hi>Venice</hi> as a very populous City, take great care to inculcate, that it hath neither Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, nor void Places, nor Church-yards, and that the Streets are very Narrow: But when, on the other hand, they would deſcribe the Beauty of <hi>Venice,</hi> they mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie its Gardens, its Places, and the breadth and number of its Canals. I read the other Day in a <hi>Venetian</hi> Author, that he counted in <hi>Venice</hi> Fifty three Publick Places, and Three hundred and thirty five Gardens. Thus you may ſee how variou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly things are preſented. But to ſpeak the Truth, there is both Truth and Falſhood in either of theſe Reports; I will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute but that there may be Fifty three
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:45740:96"/>
Spaces, great and ſmall, to which this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath thought fit to give the name of <hi>Places;</hi> and the ſame may be ſaid of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. But if we conſider theſe <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Gardens</hi> particularly, we muſt conclude him too prodigal of his honourable Titles. To ſpeak properly, there is but one <hi>Place</hi> at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> the famous and magnificent <hi>Place</hi> of St. <hi>Mark.</hi> But let us allow him the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to beſtow that Name on Five or Six void Spaces more, which have ſome ſmall Extent; yet all this comes far ſhort of Fifty three <hi>Places.</hi> There are alſo ſome Gardens here and there, particularly on the ſide of <hi>Santa Maria del' Orto;</hi> but if we ſet aſide Fifteen or Twenty, or ſhould allow Thirty, or Thirty five, to deſerve to be ſo call'd, I can poſitively averr, that the Three hundred which remain, would not, one with another, be Ten Foot ſquare; and are not theſe very noble Gardens? Nor is the other Account exactly true; for beſides that <hi>Venice</hi> may have Gardens and void Spaces, there are many parts of it very ſlenderly inhabited. It is true, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there are no Church-yards: And as for the Argument that is brought from the narrowneſs of the Streets, it is a petty Sophiſm, that may be eaſily refuted, by ſaying, that it is nothing but a bare Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Streets are ſtreight and narrow, I confeſs, and ſo narrow, that the joſtling of Elbows in the moſt frequented Places, is a great inconvenience; but I am of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that the Canals ought to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:45740:97"/>
inſtead of Streets; and if the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals were fill'd and pav'd, there would be no reaſon to complain of narrow Streets in <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I muſt tell you, ſince we are on this Subject, that all the City is ſo mangled with theſe Canals and Streets, that there are almoſt no Houſes but what you may go to by Water as well as by Land. Not that every Canal is border'd with a double Quay, as in <hi>Holland,</hi> for the conveniency of thoſe who go on Foot: There are, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſome of theſe; but very often the Canal occupies all the Space from one Range of Buildings to another. The Streets are in the little Iſles that are form'd by the Canals; ſo that there is not any part of the City, to which one may not go either with or without a <hi>Gondola.</hi> 'Tis true, all theſe little Paſſages, and all the Turns that muſt be made to find the Bridges, do make <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> a true Labyrinth.</p>
                     <p>The famous Place of St. <hi>Mark</hi> was the firſt Place which our Curioſity prompted us to viſit, after our Arrival at <hi>Venice;</hi> and it is really the Soul and Glory of that City. The Church of St. <hi>Mark</hi> fronts one of the Ends of this Place, and that of St. <hi>Geminian</hi> the other; and the <hi>Procuraties</hi> or Lawyer's Offices and Lodgings, which are built with Marble, and are both very fine and regular, border the two ſides of it with great Piazza's; which much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the <hi>Place,</hi> and at the ſame time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to its convenience. This <hi>Place</hi> is
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:45740:97"/>
Two hundred and fourſcore Foot long, and One hundred and ten broad. When you come from the Church of St. <hi>Gemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> towards that of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of entring there, turn to the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand; the <hi>Place</hi> turns alſo in form of a Square; and this Second <hi>Place,</hi> whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity reaches to the Sea, is Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Paces long, and Fourſcore broad: This is that which they call the <hi>Broglio.</hi> The Palace of the Doge is on one ſide of it, and the <hi>Procuraties</hi> are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the other. All this conſider'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, makes an admirable Show, and may paſs for a moſt magnificent <hi>Place.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Tower of St. <hi>Mark</hi> is near the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of the Square within, and does in ſome meaſure ſpoil the Symmetry of the place: This Tower is Three hundred and ſixty Foot high, comprehending the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, which ſerves for the Weather-Cock. It was formerly all over gilt, and when the Sun ſhined upon it, thoſe at Sea might perceive it at Thirty Miles diſtance; but now the Gold being gone, it ſcarcely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears. You aſcend this Tower by Stairs, without Steps, like theſe which I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where deſcrib'd; which is to be ſeen at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva.</hi> You may eaſily judge of the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Variety, and Rarity of the Landskip, which is diſcover'd from thence.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Broglio</hi> is the Walk of the Nobles: they take up always one ſide of the Place; ſometimes for the Sun, and ſometimes for the Shade, according to the Seaſon. As their
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:45740:98"/>
Number is great, and they are ordinarily to be ſeen no where elſe, the <hi>Broglio</hi> is the general Rendezvous, where Viſits are made, and moſt Affairs treated of. It is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to mingle amongſt them on that that ſide of the <hi>Promenade</hi> which they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy; but the other ſide is free. This place is ſo particularly deſtin'd, and ſet apart for them, that when a young Noble-man is come to the Age required for admittance into the Council, and to take the Robe, the firſt Day he puts it on, Four Noble-men of his Friends do ceremoniouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce him into the <hi>Broglio;</hi> and when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them are baniſh'd the Council, the entrance into the <hi>Broglio</hi> is likewiſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to them.</p>
                     <p>It was about the beginning of the Ninth Age, that the Merchants of <hi>Venice</hi> brought the Corps of St. <hi>Mark</hi> thither; they had, as is ſaid, by I know not what chance, dug it out of the Earth, in the City of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi> And as there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Tradition, which tells us, that this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt being in Priſon, Chriſt appeared to him, and ſaluted him in theſe Words; <hi>Peace be to thee, Mark, my Evangeliſt.</hi> The Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> receiv'd alſo the Body of the Saint with the ſame Words, when it was brought to their City: It is for this that you ſee them written upon the open Book, held by the Lion of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> in the Arms of <hi>Venice.</hi> You may imagine, there was great rejoycing for the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Relicks of this Evangeliſt; which
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:45740:98"/>
it ſeems they could give no greater Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of, than by preferring him, as they did, to poor St. <hi>Theodore,</hi> the ancient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of the Republick, who had not given them the leaſt cauſe of Complaint. But they ſtopt not here; for beſides divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Honours which they paid to the Bones of the New-comer, they built the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Church to his Honour, where they placed that Sacred Treaſure. It is true, they took ſo little care to diſtinguiſh the Shrine or Tomb, that they know not at preſent preciſely where it is; which is no ſmall Affliction to thoſe who bear an extraordinary Devotion to this Saint.</p>
                     <p>I will not ſtop to tell you the Hiſtory of his Apparition, (which, ſay they, happen'd Two Hundred and ſeventy Years after they had brought him to <hi>Venice</hi>) when he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Arm to the Doge, and gave him a Ring of Gold, which is carried every Year in Proceſſion, on the Twenty fifth Day of <hi>June.</hi> Nor will I tell you an infinite number of other Stories, which are made on this Occaſion.</p>
                     <p>The Patriarchal Church is dedicated to St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and that of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> as rich as it is, is but a Chapel; it is the Doge's Chapel. The <hi>Primicerio,</hi> who is the Dean of the Canons of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> wears a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Rochet, as Biſhops do, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not on the Patriarch. I have ſeen him officiate on <hi>Chriſtmas-day</hi> in great Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony; the Altar being adorn'd with moſt rich Pieces of the Treaſury: He is
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:45740:99"/>
always a noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> and his Yearly Revenue amounts to almoſt a Thouſand Pounds Sterling.</p>
                     <p>The Church of St. <hi>Mark</hi> deſerves an exact Deſcription; but that is too great a Work for a Traveller: I ſhall therefore content my ſelf with giving you ſome general Account of it. It is a Building Square, or almoſt Square, of a<note n="*" place="margin">The Church is a Croſs ſhortned, <hi>Greek</hi>-wiſe. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Gothick</hi> Ornaments.</note> 
                        <hi>Greek</hi> Structure, obſcure, and indifferent high, but extraordinarily enrich'd with Marble, and <hi>Moſaick</hi> Work. The Roof conſiſts of ſeveral Domes, and that in the midſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the reſt in greatneſs. Of all the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which are on the outſide of the Church, there are but Two good ones; The <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> by <hi>Riccio,</hi> which you ſee when you deſcend the great Stairs of the Palace. I ſpeak not of the Four Brazen Horſes which are over the great Portal, becauſe they are foreign Pieces which came thither accidentally. I learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from one skilled in Antiquity, that theſe Horſes belong'd to a Chariot of the Sun, that ſerv'd for Ornament to a Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal-Arch, which the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> erected for <hi>Nero,</hi> after the Victory of that Prince over the <hi>Parthians;</hi> which may be ſtill ſeen, ſaith he, on the Reverſe of ſome of his Medals. <hi>Conſtantine the Great</hi> carried them from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he plac'd them in the <hi>Hippodrome;</hi> and at laſt the <hi>Venetians</hi> having made themſelves Maſters of that City, brought hither ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of its rich Spoils, of which number
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:45740:99"/>
were theſe Horſes. One may ſtill perceive in ſome places that they were gilded.</p>
                     <p>One of the things which ſeems to me moſt remarkable in the Church of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> is the vaſt quantity of <hi>Moſaick</hi> Work, with which it is adorn'd. All the Pavement is made of it, and all its ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Roofs are cover'd with it. Becauſe you have not ſeen this kind of Work, and would have me to ſay ſomething of it, I will explain it to you as well as I can. <hi>Moſaick</hi> Work came from <hi>Greece,</hi> but they tell us that the uſe of it hath been in <hi>Italy</hi> for near Two Thouſand Years paſt. <hi>Vitruvius</hi> who lived in the time of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> ſpeaks of it under the terms of <hi>opus ſectile, pavimenta ſectilia, opera muſaea &amp; muſiva:</hi> It was likewiſe called <hi>teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellatum &amp; vermiculatum opus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All Works compos'd of little inlaid Pieces, whether they be of Stone, Wood, Ivory, Enamel, or any other Matter; or whether they be Repreſentations of Things Natural, or only <hi>Morisk</hi> or <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan</hi> Figures; all theſe are comprehended under the name of <hi>Moſaick:</hi> So that there are many faſhions of it. You know what Inlaid Work is; you have alſo ſeen the fine Works of <hi>Florence</hi> Stone; and to ſpeak after a looſer manner, all theſe are <hi>Moſaick.</hi> And that which makes the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Ornament of the Church of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> is, that almoſt all the Work is of this nature. For want of Natural Stones, which would be hard to find for a Work
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:45740:100"/>
ſo vaſt, and which would take up an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe time to poliſh and prepare; They have recourſe to Paſtes, and compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Glaſs and Enamel, which they make in a Crucible or Melting-Pot; this takes a moſt lively and ſhining Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which never wears nor ſtains. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Piece of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> of St. <hi>Mark</hi> is a little Cube, which is not above Three Lines thick, or Four at the moſt. All the Field is of <hi>Moſaick,</hi> gilded with moſt bright Gold, and incorporated in the Fire, upon the Superficies of one of the Faces of the Square: And all theſe Figures with their Draperies and Ornaments, are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured according to nature, by the due lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together of all the Pieces of the Work. All theſe little bits are diſpoſed according to the Deſign which the Workman, has in view, and are ſtrictly adjuſted together in the compound Matter, or Plaiſter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to receive them; which preſently after becomes hard. The beſt of this Work is its ſolidity. It is more than Eight hundred and fifty Years that it hath laſted, without the leaſt diminution of its Beauty.</p>
                     <p>The Pavement of the Church is alſo exceedingly Curious; and tho' it hath been in many places very much ſpoil'd, and in ſome places worn, it may be thought a kind of Miracle that ſuch great pieces remain ſtill entire, after they have been trod under Foot for ſo many Ages. They are little pieces of <hi>Jaſpar,</hi>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:45740:100"/>
of <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> ſpotted green <hi>Marble,</hi> and <hi>Marble</hi> of divers Colours, which make al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Compartiments different from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>I paſs by the Relicks, the miraculous Images, and the other Holy Rarities which are in this Church; only I ſhall menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one of them, which ſeems to me the moſt curious, <hi>viz.</hi> the Rock which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtruck in the Wilderneſs; It is in the Chapel of—at the end of the Font; it is a kind of greyiſh Marble: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more pleaſant than the Three little Holes out of which they affirm the Water iſſued: They are plac'd Triangular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, about Two Fingers from each other, and the Bore of each hole is no bigger than the hollow of a Gooſe-Quill. I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, it is a double Miracle, that ſo much Water, in ſo little Time, ſhould iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue out of ſuch narrow Holes, as ſhould ſuffice to quench the thirſt of an Army of Six hundred thouſand Men, with all their Wives, Children, and Cattle.</p>
                     <p>They made us obſerve a Piece of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrie,</hi> enchas'd in the Pavement, in the middle of the Portico of the Church, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt the great Door; it is to mark out the Place wherein Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> III. ſet his Foot, as they ſay, on the Neck of the Emperor <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa,</hi> when that Prince came to ſubmit to him for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of a Peace. I am not ignorant that <hi>Baronius</hi> and ſome others, have criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cized this Hiſtory, and rejected it as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:45740:101"/>
But I muſt tell you, by the by, ſince Opportunity preſents, that what-ever probability may ſeem to be in the Reaſons, they alledge, they cannot paſs for more than Suſpicions and Conjectures, and can never amount to a convincing Refutation of a Story atteſted by ſo great a number of Authors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alexander</hi> III. was a haughty Man, his Enemies had provoked him, and he at laſt had the Pleaſure to Triumph over an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and Four Anti-Popes. At the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time of his flight into <hi>France,</hi> he was ſo proud as to ſuffer<note n="*" place="margin">

                        </note> Two Kings who met him, to alight, and both to take the Reins of his Bridle, and lead his Horſe to the Lodging prepared for him. If he did this in his Diſgrace, what might he not do in his Proſperity?</p>
                     <p>From the Church of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> we went into the <hi>Treaſury;</hi> Three Procurators of St. <hi>Mark</hi> are the Adminiſtrators of it; and it is never open'd, but in the preſence of one of them. In the firſt place, you ſee there the Relicks, Pieces of the true Croſs; the Bones of the Dead; the Hair and Milk of the Virgin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From thence you paſs into another Chamber, where the real Treaſure is kept. The greateſt part of the things to be ſeen there, were brought from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> at the ſame time with the Brazen Horſes, which I mentioned before.

But the bare Tradition is not a ſufficient Demonſtration that it is the Hand of St. <hi>Mark:</hi> The manner of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting which I obſerv'd, makes me fanſie that it's rather the Work of ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Tranſcriber.

                     <p>The Palace of St. <hi>Mark</hi> joins to the Church: It is a great Building, after the <hi>Gothick</hi> manner, yet 'tis very Magnificent: It hath been burned four or five times; and the various Reparations of it have ſpoiled the Uniformity of the Structure. The ſide which is on the Canal, is built
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:45740:103"/>
of a kind of hard Stone, brought from <hi>Iſtria,</hi> and the Architecture of it is highly eſteem'd: Were the reſt of the Building ſuitable, it would be a moſt excellent Piece. The Duke is lodg'd in this Palace; and here it is that the Council of State and all the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy do meet. The Apartments are large, lofty, and well wainſcotted, but dark in compariſon of the Light now a-days requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Buildings. The Hall where the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Nobles aſſemble, which, as you know, compoſes the <hi>Grand Council,</hi> in which the Sovereignty of the State reſides, is extraordinary large, and adorn'd with Pictures; among which are the Portraitures of the Dukes; the Hiſtory of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which was taken in the Year 1192, and loſt about Threeſcore Years after; the Picture of <hi>Frederick</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> is there alſo, of the largeſt ſize, and they have not forgot the Circumſtance of the Foot on the Neck. What I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd on this Picture, gives me opportunity to add ſomething to what I have already told you on the ſame Subject. I think we ought not to take it in a rigorous and ſtrictly literal Sence, what is commonly ſaid; That the Pope ſet <hi>his</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">His Cloaths of Gold being laid down at the Feet of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> he begg'd Pardon, and the Pope putting his Right Foot on his Neck, ſaid the Words of the Pſalm, <hi>Super Aſpidem &amp; Baſiliſcum am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulabis, &amp; conculcabis Leonem &amp; Draconem:</hi> At which Provocation the Emperour anſwer'd, <hi>Non tibi, ſed Petro.</hi> And the Pope treading harder, ſaid, <hi>Et mihi, &amp; Petro. Theodor. Valle Lit. di Pip. ch. 10.</hi> The ſame Story is unanimouſly related by a Thouſand other Authors.</note> 
                        <hi>Foot on the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's Neck.</hi> This Action would become leſs odious, and eaſier to be believ'd, when
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:45740:103"/>
it ſhall be compared to what is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this ancient Picture. The Pope therein appears to put his Foot lightly on the Shoulder of the Emperour, without ſhowing any Motion of Paſſion: And tho' the Hiſtory of the Popes mentions a great Number of 'em as outragious in their Pride, Brutiſhneſs, and Rage; and tho' this <hi>Alexander,</hi> Proud as he was, and of a revengeful Spirit, might then be guilty of any thing; nevertheleſs an act of Violence on ſuch an Occaſion, amongſt Strangers, in a Publick Place, and in the ſight of all the People, would have been, if well weigh'd, contrary to the Policy, as well as the Gravity of God's Vicar; whereas, it was not only a noble Briskneſs, but alſo the Duty of him who ſupplies the Place of the Maſter of the Univerſe, and whoſe Government extends it ſelf over all the Kings of the World, on ſuch an Occaſion to maintain the Dignity of his Character. It is true, that the Submiſſion and Repentance of the Vaſſal, ought to have been receiv'd with a Spirit of Meekneſs; but it was juſt that he ſhould not be acquitted for a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Reverence. It was requiſite, as I have ſaid, that the Lieutenant of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſhould maintain the Intereſt of his Maſter, and that, at leaſt, he ſhould make his Power be known at the ſame time that he granted his Pardon. And if it be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that all this Diſcourſe is founded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the Fancy of a Painter, who hath repreſented this Story as he thought fit; I
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:45740:104"/>
will anſwer firſt, that this is a meer preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious aſſertion. Painters do not always give themſelves a latitude, nor do they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily do it to the prejudice of an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant circumſtance. And I muſt tell you in the ſecond place, that it is more reaſonable to believe this Picture, than to form chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Notions to contradict it.</p>
                     <p>Some will perhaps alledge, that the Shoulder is not the Neck, but It hink it not worth the while to reply to ſo frivolous an Objection. I hope you will pardon this little digreſſion, to which I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly engaged, by reaſon of the diſcourſe we had on this Subject.</p>
                     <p>I have yet two things to relate to you, of the Palace of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> which, amongſt others, ſeem very remarkable. The Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of <hi>Bajamonte,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Bajamonte <hi>Tiepele,</hi> in the Year <hi>1210.</hi>
                        </note> the Story of which you know, was the occaſion of ſetting up a little Arſenal in the Palace, to which there is a Paſſage from the Hall of the Grand Council, by a Gallery of Communication; to the end, that if there ſhould be a Plot of the People againſt the Nobility, and they ſhould enterpriſe any thing againſt them whilſt they are ſitting, they might readily find Arms to defend themſelves. It is alſo, as I may tell you by the by, to provide for their Security, that they have built the little Judgment-ſeat called the <hi>Loggietta,</hi> which is at the foot of the Tower of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> in ſight of the Palace, and of the Chamber of the Grand Council. There are always ſome of the Procurators of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:45740:104"/>
St. <hi>Mark</hi> there, upon the Watch, whilſt the Grand Council is aſſembled, and at the ſame time are doing other buſineſs. This Arſenal is furniſhed with a competent number of Fuſees and Muſquets, which lie always ready charged, and a great many other good Arms. There is a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine which ſerves to light five hundred Matches at a time. Beſides theſe, they keep there a quantity of curious ancient Arms, amongſt which they preſerve with great care, the Sword of the Valiant <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg.</hi> I obſerv'd alſo there the Buſt of<note n="*" place="margin">Strangled at <hi>Padua</hi> with his four Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by order of the Senate of <hi>Venice,</hi> in the Year <hi>1405.</hi>

                        <hi>Francis Carrara,</hi> the laſt Lord of <hi>Padua,</hi> ſo famous for his Cruelties. They ſhew there a little Trunk or <hi>Toilette,</hi> in which are ſix little Guns, which were ſo ordered with Springs adjuſted in ſuch a manner, that upon the opening of the Trunk, the Guns fir'd, and kill'd the Lady, to whom <hi>Carrara</hi> had ſent it for a Preſent. They ſhow alſo with this, ſome little Pocket Croſs-Bows, and Arrows of Steel, with which he made Sport to kill thoſe he met, without their perceiving the Stroke, or him that gave it. There are alſo Locks, and ſundry kinds of Bolts, with which that beaſtly Monſter lock'd up his Whores. I muſt not forget the two little Statues of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> which <hi>Albert Durer</hi> made in Priſon, with the point of a Pen-knife only, and for which he obtain'd his Liberty.</p>
                     <p>The other particulars which I ſhall yet obſerve of the Palace of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> are the Antick Mouths under the inner Portico; and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:45740:105"/>
in ſeveral places of the Galleries there are ſeveral Heads jutting out,<note place="margin">The Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

                     <p>The Library is in the <hi>Procuraties</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt the Palace, and on the other ſide of the <hi>Broglio;</hi> there are ſeveral <hi>Greek</hi> Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts in it, which were given by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Beſſarion,</hi> who you know was a <hi>Grecian.</hi> I could not learn that there was any thing rare in this Library, only another Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, <hi>De conſideratione Dei,</hi> which they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to St. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> I cannot tell what reaſons induce them to believe it, but it is very certain, that the Title of this Treatiſe is not in the Index of <hi>Poſſidius.</hi> A Friend of mine, who hath travelled into <hi>Spain,</hi> told me, that there is in the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript-Treatiſe <hi>of Baptiſm,</hi> which alſo paſſes for St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s, and which is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that which we have of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: Doctor againſt the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> They ſay in that Country, that <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth refuſed fifty thouſand Piſtols for it. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that poor Prince would have gladly taken them, when at his latter End he was forced to ſell his Jewels. But to return to the Library; tho' it be none of the moſt numerous, rareſt, and beſt condition'd Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries in the World; yet, to make amends,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:45740:105"/>
it is adorn'd with Pictures, by <hi>Titian,</hi> and ſome other famous Maſters, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely eſteemed. There are alſo many <hi>Greek</hi> Statues of admirable Beauty, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the above-mention'd <hi>Ganymede,</hi> carried away by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> transformed into an Eagle; a <hi>Venus;</hi> an <hi>Apollo;</hi> and two Gladiators. They give out, that there are as many fine Pictures at <hi>Venice,</hi> as at <hi>Rome,</hi> and we have already ſeen good ſtore of them: But this is a ſubject I pretend not to enter upon: I will only tell you, that the three moſt celebrated Pieces that are to be ſeen in the Churches, or in publick Places, are the Wedding of <hi>Cana,</hi> by <hi>Paul Veroneſe,</hi> in the Refectory of St. <hi>George Major.</hi> The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Virgin by <hi>Titian,</hi> in the School of Charity.

Venice</hi> is perhaps the only City of <hi>Europe,</hi> where young Painters may beſt Study Nature it ſelf. There are two Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies, where there are always naked Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of both Sexes to be viewed, and which are often on the Stage together, in what poſture they pleaſe to put them. Every body may come in there, and you cannot believe with what boldneſs theſe little Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will endure to be gazed on by all the World.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall anſwer in a few words your Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion concerning the Flux and Reflux, by confirming, without doubt, what you have learned elſewhere. The Sea flows ſix hours, and ebbs as much: It is later
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:45740:106"/>
every day by three quarters of an hour, or thereabouts, as upon the Coaſts of the Sea you are acquainted with; and the Tide riſes ordinarily at <hi>Venice</hi> four foot, or four foot and an half. But it is ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſs, as in all other places; and it agrees with the Moon, after the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual manner: I ſhall take care to impart to you the Obſervations I made all along the Gulf from <hi>Ravenna</hi> to <hi>Loretto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Shore is extreamly pleaſant beyond thoſe long and narrow Iſles, which make as it were Banks on the <hi>Eaſt</hi> ſide, and which form a kind of Semicircle from <hi>North</hi> to <hi>South,</hi> round about <hi>Venice.</hi> This is properly called the main Sea: There you find Shell-fiſh, and the Walk is very diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing when the Weather is Calm. They get ſtore of Oyſters there, but they want the excellent ſavour of ours. They are looked upon as hurtful, and Strangers ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from eating ſo many as in other places.</p>
                     <p>You have reaſon to ſay, that Policy and Liberty are two Words, which are in high eſteem at <hi>Venice.</hi> But it muſt be allowed, that it is not the <hi>Venetians</hi> only who mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie their own Policy. All the World, in my Opinion, doth acknowledge, that they endeavour'd to refine this Study, and have gained the point. This is an Opinion which I neither can nor will conteſt; I ſhall only offer two Obſervations touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Subject: The firſt is, that when we ſpeak generally of the Policy of <hi>Venice,</hi>
                        <pb n="173" facs="tcp:45740:106"/>
we run immediately to a conſideration which fills our Minds with Prejudices. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we proceed to take a nearer and more exact view of this boaſted Policy, we judge of it by a deceitful appearance of a falſe and ill-grounded Experience. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick of <hi>Venice,</hi> ſay they, hath main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it ſelf for theſe twelve or thirteen hundred Years. What a wonderful thing is this, add they, and what greater proof can be deſired of the Excellency of its Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? I ſay, that by reſting here, without further ſcrutiny, they draw a falſe Conſequence from an ill-grounded Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. To reaſon juſtly, after this manner of ſpeaking, the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> muſt really have always maintain'd it ſelf under one and the ſame Government: One might then admire the wiſe and happy Conduct of its Counſels, which, by the various re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults of their Prudence, had preſerved their State for ſo long a ſucceſſion of Ages. But the buſineſs will not go that way. To what purpoſe is it to diſſemble, what is obvious to the ſight and knowledge of all the World? The truth is, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Venice</hi> hath often changed its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, without affirming what ſome maintain, that this Republick hath rendred Homage to the Kings of <hi>Italy.</hi> It is in vain to deny, that the Dukes were for a long time abſolute Sovereigns; whether by Right or Uſurpation, it matters not. The Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> was no more a Republick, when their Dukes commanded
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:45740:107"/>
there with an Arbitrary Power, than the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> was a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, under the firſt <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, or during the Triumvirate. And therefore we muſt carefully obſerve the differerence between theſe two Propoſitions: <hi>The Republick of</hi> Venice <hi>maintained it ſelf for twelve hundred Years; or,</hi> Venice <hi>was a State, or the Head of a State for twelve hundred Years.</hi> The firſt of theſe Propoſitions, in a ſtrict ſenſe, is really falſe; for the Reaſons I alledged. The ſecond is true; but nothing can be concluded from it. One might as well ſay, that <hi>Rome</hi> has been the Head of a State, for above two thouſand four hundred Years, but could not from thence conclude, that the State of <hi>Rome</hi> had maintained it ſelf during all that time; for to change its face and conſtitution, is not to maintain it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>My ſecond Remark upon this Policy, which makes ſo much noiſe, is, that the Signiory of <hi>Venice</hi> being confin'd within ſo narrow limits, in compariſon of the great States of the World, and all the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of this Republick; I ſpeak princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally as it ſtands at preſent, being only to live quietly and peaceably with all the World; I ſee no neceſſity it hath of ſuch great activity of Spirit, or high efforts of Wit, to maintain it ſelf in quiet. When the Republick of <hi>Rome</hi> aſpired to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the Univerſe, when it endeavoured to fill the World with its Colonies, and had already made ſo many Kings its Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butaries,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:45740:107"/>
and was to find out the Secret, to make it ſelf both feared and loved by the Provinces it had newly ſubdued; then it was that Policy was neceſſarily required. But there is no ſuch occaſion for it at <hi>Venice.</hi> If the little Republick of St. <hi>Marin</hi> ſhould make Rhodomontades of its Policy on the <hi>Broglio,</hi> do you not think it would juſtly be laugh'd at? And, without derogating from the Glory and Power that <hi>Venice</hi> hath ſeveral times acquired; it is certainly true, that <hi>Venice</hi> is no more to be compared to old <hi>Rome,</hi> than St. <hi>Marin</hi> can come in competition with <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I might add, for a third Remark, that the wonderful Policy of <hi>Venice</hi> hath not hindred the many declenſions into which that Republick hath fallen.</p>
                     <p>The Commonwealth's-men talk of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their Liberty; yet theſe poor People are Slaves to their Maſters, as all other People are, under what Government ſoever they live: And, in the mean time, they ſtuff their Heads, with I know not what pretended notions of Liberty, as if every one of them were a little Prince. But it muſt be confeſſed, that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Venice,</hi> have more reaſon than any to boaſt of theirs. I will tell you in two words, what that Liberty is: You muſt never in the leaſt meddle with the Affairs of State: You muſt commit no enormous Crimes puniſhable by Juſtice, which may render you, by their notoriety ſubject to be taken notice of; and for the reſt, you
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:45740:108"/>
may do what you pleaſe, without troubling your Head with what People talk of you. This is the ſumm of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Liberty. I might tell you many things on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, very particular and ſcarcely to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved: But theſe reflections having already carried me too far, we will deferr the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration of 'em to another oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
                     <p>To anſwer your Queſtions about the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of Religions, I can tell you, that the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> are allow'd the publick Exerciſe of their Religions; all other Sects are ſuffer'd or conniv'd at, but they order their Meetings after ſo ſecret and prudent a manner, that the Senate hath no reaſon to complain of the Abuſes or Indiſcretion of any Perſon.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, though the Worſhipping of Images and Reliques, and many other Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions reign at <hi>Venice,</hi> it is only amongſt the common People, to whom they are willing to grant theſe amuſements. The eminent Wits care neither for this, nor any thing elſe. Formerly the <hi>Venetians</hi> were as ſimple as the reſt of the Popiſh World. The Excommunications of the Pope ſcared them, and ſometimes did them a great deal of Miſchief. That of <hi>Clement</hi> V. for example, made a terrible pother among 'em, and ſpoiled all their Trade: But now they trouble not themſelves about 'em, and the Liberties of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Church are at preſent as great as thoſe of the <hi>Gallican.</hi> They take notice of the Pope as a Prince, but do
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:45740:108"/>
not much regard him as Pope. When the Jeſuites, who are the moſt potent ſupport of that which they call the Holy See, would have ſubmitted themſelves to the order of Suſpenſion, which all the Clergy of <hi>Venice</hi> had from Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth, they were drawn out as Enemies and Diſturbers of the State. And tho' for ſome Reaſons at the inſtant ſollicitations of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> they were afterwards recalled; it was on condition that they ſhould not raiſe Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as they formerly had done. And even tho' they continu'd ſtill to entertain ſuch deſigns, the Republick knows how to order them: but conſidering the Precautions that are uſed, the toleration of the Jeſuites at <hi>Venice</hi> can produce no ill Conſequences: For, as I am told, they ſuffer none there but ſuch as are born ſubjects to the State; and they aſſure me, that the Superiour muſt be a Native of the City. In a word, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Meſſieurs of <hi>Venice</hi> ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be Governed neither by the Prieſts nor the Monks. Thoſe Fathers are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to wear Masks during the Carnival, to treat their Concubines, ſing on the Stages, and do what they pleaſe, but they dare not thruſt their Noſes into the Affairs of State. The Senate is wiſe enough to be ſenſible of the diſorders which happen when they are permitted to meddle with the Government: Nor do they conſult them when any thing comes under deliberation.</p>
                     <p>I have taken particular care to examine the Creed of the <hi>Greeks</hi> which are here,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:45740:109"/>
touching the Articles of which you write. But to ſpeak freely, though I find them profeſſed Enemies of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and that they declaim furiouſly againſt the Uſurpations of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> when they ſpeak with freedom: I perceive by their Diſcourſe, that whether by Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or by ſome other reaſon they differ very much in many points from the other <hi>Greek</hi> Churches, which are at preſent under the Dominion of the <hi>Turk;</hi> at leaſt if we may believe the relations of thoſe Countries. So that the Opinions of theſe ought not to make us conclude any thing concerning the belief of the <hi>Greeks</hi> in general. To deal plainly with you, they declare that they believe Tranſubſtantiation, which is not enough to determine the Queſtion, which has made ſo much noiſe, and at the bottom makes nothing againſt thoſe who will not admit that Doctrine. They make uſe of common Bread, they mingle Water with the Wine, and communicate under both kinds. There are two Altars in their Church, one which they call the Altar of <hi>Preparation,</hi> and the other of <hi>Conſecration.</hi> On the firſt they cut the Bread with a Knife, like the Steel head of a Spear. There alſo they mingle the Water with the Wine, and the Prieſt takes it with a Sponge out of the Veſſel in which it was firſt mixed, and afterwards ſqueezes it out into the Chalice. They embrace one another before they receive the Sacrament: And the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants receive the Bread ſteeped in the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:45740:109"/>
Wine, the Prieſt putting it with a Spoon into their Mouths: All this we ſaw. The Arch-Biſhop who officiated, had a Mitre faſhioned like an Imperial Crown, and all his other Ornaments were magnificent; and they were changed from time to time, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeveral parts of the Service.</p>
                     <p>There are amongſt them an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Ceremonies and Myſteries. When the Biſhop bleſſes the People, he holdeth in his Right-hand a Candleſtick of three branches, with the Tapers lighted, which is as an Emblem of the Perſons of the Trinity. The Candleſtick which he holds in his Left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, hath two Branches, to denote the two Natures of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage further into the confuſed number of theſe myſterious Repreſentations. Their Churches are divided into four Parts; the Altars are in the place which they call Holy, at one end of the Church. There are none but he who officiates, and thoſe who ſerve him who commonly enter there. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place is appointed for the other parts of the Service: The Men are in the third place, which is ſeparated only from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond by little Baliſters, and the Women are behind a Lettice, at the other end of the Church, or in the Galleries. All the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is perform'd in vulgar <hi>Greek,</hi> which is their natural Language, and underſtood by the People. They highly condemn the uſe of unknown Languages in the Church: They worſhip ſtanding, bowing the Head, and putting their Hands on their Breaſt.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:45740:110"/>
Thoſe who are married, may come to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtial Preferments without quitting their Wives: But thoſe that are received before Marriage, are not afterwards ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to marry. They ſay decency permits not a Perſon to marry above thrice; ſo that they forbid fourth Marriages. They deny Purgatory, and you know by what Principles: They pray for the Dead. There are very few here who believe a Temporary Hell from which the Elect are delivered; but they pray for the Souls which they ſay are in a ſeparate State, expecting the laſt Judgment. The uſe of Confeſſion is much practiſed amongſt them, but not after the <hi>Roman</hi> manner. The Article of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the Holy Ghoſt, they put in the rank of thoſe which are more curious than edifying; inſomuch that it is now paſſed over with as much ſilence as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it made noiſe. They keep certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks as precious and ſacred Memorials, but render no Worſhip to them. I remember I have read in <hi>Thevet,</hi> That the <hi>Greeks</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> ſolemnly excommunicate the Pope on <hi>Good-Friday.</hi> And the Monk <hi>Surras</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, That at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> they pray to God every day in a certain part of the Publick Service, that he would keep them ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dominion of the <hi>Turk,</hi> rather than ſuffer them to fall under that of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have uſed all my endeavours to obtain ſome particular Information, concerning the Creed and Worſhip of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> that I might know it from the firſt hand;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:45740:110"/>
but I have not hitherto had an opportunity to get acquaintance with any of them, nor have I yet been preſent at their Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, becauſe they are at preſent at Work in the repair of their Church, and ſo cannot yet aſſemble there. One of my Friends, among other things, aſſur'd me of theſe four or five Articles. That they Communicate under both kinds: That they give the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to little Children: That they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the ſequeſtration of Souls as the <hi>Greeks</hi> do: That they give a Bill of Divorce: That they believe there will be no difference of Sexes after the Reſurrection. And after all, there are ſo many particular Opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all theſe People, that it is not eaſie to tell poſitively what they believe.</p>
                     <p>There are yet many particulars in my Journal, with which I might entertain you at preſent; but I had rather joyn them to thoſe other Obſervations which I ſhall make hereafter, that I may have occaſion to add alſo ſuch new Inſtructions as I hope to receive.</p>
                     <p>I was juſt now with the Abbot <hi>Lith,</hi> whom I mention'd before; and it comes into my Mind to inform you, before I fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh my Letter, of a thing which he aſſured me of, and I ſhould have been ſorry to have forgotten, though it hath no relation to <hi>Venice.</hi> We were diſcourſing of the few numerous Families which are taken notice of here, in compariſon to other places; and he told me, on this occaſion, that one of his Kindred had twenty four Sons by one Wife, who were all marri'd; and that all
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:45740:111"/>
the twenty four with their ſeveral Wives, had been ſeen in a Company together: Though there is nothing in this but what is very poſſible, yet is it a thing extreamly rare.</p>
                     <p>I hope I ſhall quickly receive one of your Letters: As for me, I will not fail to write to you before I depart from hence.</p>

                        <pb n="185" facs="tcp:45740:114"/>The beſt Houſes of <hi>Venice</hi> are upon the great Canal; and there are ſome which appear very<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Above all the Palaces of</hi> Piſani, Moro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſini, Loroda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, Roſini, Vandramino, Grimani.</note> magnificent: Theſe are great Bulks, which would have no Beauty, were it not for the Mask which I told you of in my Letter from <hi>Vicenza;</hi> I mean that Frontiſpiece which commonly conſiſts of Two or Three Orders of Architecture, and which covers the Building on that ſide which is moſt in view; and the reſt is ill order'd, and no way pleaſing to the Eye, I mean the reſt of their out-ſides.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lagunes</hi> may cauſe you to judge, that the Air of <hi>Venice</hi> is unwholſome; but they aſſure us of the contrary. However they cannot ſay the ſame of the Water, which is almoſt all very bad. Of more than One hundred and fifty Wells which are here, there are but Two or Three good for any thing; and the beſt Water is the Rain-Water which ſome private Perſons reſerve in Ciſterns. The common Wines are alſo very unpleaſant; that which they call <hi>(dolce) ſweet,</hi> is of a pall'd, diſguſtful taſte; and the <hi>(Garbo)</hi> or <hi>ſowre,</hi> on the contrary is extreamly ſharp. After they have drawn off the pure Liquor, they mix Water with the Husks, that they may ſqueeze ſome ſharpneſs from the Grapes, which give it ſome piquant briskneſs, but makes it very harſh; otherwiſe this mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture palls the Wine very much, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens it, which never had much Strength in it ſelf. They have alſo a very ill way of making their Bread; Let it be as freſh as
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:45740:115"/>
you will, the Paſte is ſo hard, that you muſt break it as they do Bisket, with a Hammer. In other things you are well enough treated.</p>
                     <p>Strangers have ſo little Commerce with the Natives of this Country, that it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to learn their Cuſtoms, and Manners of Houſe-keeping: Wherefore I can ſay very little concerning theſe things. I read the other day in a Preface of <hi>Henry Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens,</hi> that in his time, they had an ill O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in <hi>France,</hi> of a Woman who went Bare-Neck'd; whereas in <hi>Italy,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly at <hi>Venice,</hi> every old Hag expos'd her wither'd and ſwagging Breaſts to view. But things are much<note n="*" place="margin">There are none but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Whores who ſhew their Necks bare.</note> chang'd ſince his time. At preſent the Women of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are ſhut up ſo cloſe, that you can ſcarcely ſee their Face; not even in the Churches, which are the only places where they appear in Publick. When they go abroad, they are ſhut up in their <hi>Gondo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>'s, and accompanied with Two or Three old Women, who never leave them. The ordinary Women cover themſelves with a great Scarf, which opens only a little before their Eyes; and they go abroad but rarely, becauſe the Men make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, and take care of all Buſineſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Doors.</p>
                     <p>They ſend the Girls to the Convent in their tendereſt Infancy; and when grown up, they conclude their Marriages without their Knowledge; nay often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out letting them ſee their future Husbands.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:45740:115"/>
That you may not be ſurprized at this, you are to know that they make not Marriages here on the ſame Accounts they do in other places. They never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves with Love, Affection, or Eſteem. If any of thoſe things happen, it is good luck; but they mind nothing but Kindred and Riches, not regarding the Perſon. The uſe of Concubines is ſo generally receiv'd, that the greateſt part of the Wives live in good Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with their Rivals; and that way the Men remedy the perſonal Faults of the Women which they marry. There is alſo another ſort of keeping Concubines, very much uſed by thoſe of tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; a thing in truth very rare at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi> It is a kind of clandeſtine Marriage, the Ceremony whereof is not perform'd a long time after the Conſummation; and commonly ſome Days, or ſome Hours perhaps, only before the death of one of the Parties. The Men find this Method convenient, becauſe it keeps the Women in perpetual awe, and conſtant complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, being in daily fear of being turn'd off. I know a rich Merchant who hath lived thus for above Twenty Years with his Female Companion; when he is in a good Humour, he will promiſe to marry her before he dies, and make their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren his Heirs. But the moſt uſual pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is, to live on the Common, at ſo long kept, ſo much paid, until the firſt deſire of change, without fixing on any
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:45740:116"/>
certain Perſon either for Wife or Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine. Thoſe who have not the Means ſingly to keep a Whore, join with Two or Three Friends; and this Plurality, which would in other places be inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, does here make the Knot of Friendſhip firmer between Companions of equal Fortunes. Libertiniſm, in reſpect of Women, is turn'd to ſo common and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral a Cuſtom, that, to ſpeak truly, it takes away all ſence and remembrance of the Sin. As one of their fineſt Stroaks of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy here, is to bring up all Perſons in Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminacy, and eſpecially the young Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: The Mothers are the firſt who find out Courteſans for their Sons, that they may be ſure to hinder them from falling into Contagious Pits; and when they have agreed with the Father and Mother for ſome young poor Maiden; all her Kindred come, and in cold Blood, wiſh her Joy, as if it were for a Marriage lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. You would be ſurprized to ſee a Mother deliver up her Daughter, for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Summ of Money, Monthly or Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paid; and ſwear ſolemly by God, and her own Soul, that ſhe cannot afford it for leſs. We muſt not ſay that all Mothers will do the ſame, but certainly it is a thing commonly practiſed. I was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a good Catholick, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors will not trouble themſelves with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Stories of this Work, they will not hear ſuch Trifles, but ask preſently, <hi>quatite altra coſa, ſomething elſe.</hi> Beſides, there are
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:45740:116"/>
none but ſome Fools of Foreign Courteſans, who by a kind of nice Scruple which they bring from their own Country, have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd themſelves from time to time to hear a Maſs. It is true, this coſts them but little, becauſe thoſe they employ have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally need of their Aſſiſtance; they are not unkind to each other; and it is not difficult ſo to order Affairs, that they may have no occaſion to be out of Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. There are whole Streets of Ladies of Pleaſure, who entertain all Comers; and whereas the Habits of other Perſons are black and melancholy, theſe are cloathed in red and yellow, like Tulips; with their Breaſts open, their Faces painted foot deep, and always a Noſegay above their Ears: you may ſee them by Dozens at the Gates or Windows; and the Paſſers by ſeldom 'ſcape them without a torn Sleeves.</p>
                     <p>The Carnival always begins the ſecond Holiday in <hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> that is to ſay, from thence they are permitted to wear Masks, and to open the Play-Houſes and Gaming-Houſes: Then they are not ſatisfied with the ordinary Libertiniſm, they improve all their Pleaſures, and plunge into them up to the Neck. All the City is diſguis'd; Vice and Vertue were never ſo well coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited, and abſolutely change both Names and Cuſtoms. The place of St. <hi>Mark</hi> is fill'd with a Thouſand ſorts of Jack-Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. Strangers and Courteſans come in Shoals from all parts of <hi>Europe:</hi> There is every where a general Motion and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:45740:117"/>
You would ſwear, that all the World were turn'd Fools in an Inſtant. It is true, that the fury of theſe Baccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals comes not preſently to the height; there is ſome moderation in the beginning. But when they begin to be ſenſible of the dreaded Approach of the fatal <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> which impoſes an univerſal Silence, then it is that they celebrate their great Feaſts, and all without revel on <hi>Shrove-Tueſday</hi> Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade. Since it is true, that every thing muſt be attributed to the Policy of <hi>Venice,</hi> you muſt ſuppoſe there are particulr Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the permitting this Licentiouſneſs of the Carnival; and perhaps we need not ſearch for any great Myſtery. I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Two things which come into my Head on this Occaſion: The common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple always love Sports and other Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. As abominable as that Monſter <hi>Nero</hi> was, he was lamented by the Mobb, becauſe of his Shows. I imagine then, that the Nobility, who otherwiſe are not well beloved, are very glad to find ſome cunning ways to pleaſe and amuſe the People. There is yet another thing which ſeems to me of ſome moment. I am credibly inform'd, that at the laſt Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nival, there was an account of Seven So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Princes, and Thirty thouſand other Foreigners. Conſider how much Money all this Multitude muſt have brought to <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I muſt, according to your deſire, give you my Sentiment of the Opera's and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:45740:117"/>
acted here; tho' in the mean time, I muſt confeſs my averſeneſs to meddle with this particular; becauſe I fear I ſhall in your Opinion be eſteem'd too ſingular in mine. You ſeem to me to be poſſeſſed with great Prejudices in favour of theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Shows; and I fanſie you expect ſomething which may exceed the <hi>Idea</hi> you have already ſeen of them. I entreat you then, to ſet aſide all your Prejudices, and to believe I will do as much; that I may be able to give you an impartial Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of things as I found them. I will do it in few Words, without criticiſing on Opera's in general, in which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been offended at ſome Paſſages which ſeem contrary both to Probability and Reaſon. But ſince you will have it ſo, we will ſuppoſe that all the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of an Opera, is the beſt contrived thing in the World; and I will keep my ſelf within the Bounds you have preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed me, which is to ſpeak to you with relation to Opera's which you have ſeen at <hi>Paris:</hi> It is undeniable matter of Fact, that the Ornaments of thoſe here fall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſhort of theſe; the Habits are poor, no Dances, and commonly no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines, nor any Illuminations, only ſome Candles here and there, which deſerve not to be mentioned. 'Tis dangerous not to magnifie the <hi>Italian</hi> Muſick, or to ſay, at leaſt, any thing againſt it. Neither will I inſiſt on this Subject, but confeſs, in the general, that they have moſt excellent
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:45740:118"/>
Ayres, and that there are ſome good Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces amongſt them. Thus, for Example, the <hi>Vicentin</hi> Songſter of the <hi>Hoſpitalettes</hi> is a little charming Creature. But I cannot forbear telling you, that I find I know not what Confuſion and Unpleaſantneſs in ſeveral Parts of the Songs in their Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's: They dwell many times longer on one Quavering, than in ſinging Four whole Lines; and often they run ſo faſt, that it is hard to tell whether they Sing or Speak, or whether they do either or both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Every one has his Humour for me; I confeſs, amongſt other things, the over-ſtrain'd Shrill agrees not with me, tho' there be much trouble to reach it, and it be wonderfully grateful to the Ears of thoſe People. The Concert is much leſs than at <hi>Paris,</hi> but perhaps it is never the worſe for that. There is alſo one thing which charms them, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve would not pleaſe you; I mean thoſe unhappy Men who baſely ſuffer themſelves to be maimed, that they may have the finer Voices. The ſilly Figure, which in my Opinion, ſuch a mutilated Fellow makes, who one time acts the Bully, and ſometimes the Paſſionate Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, with his Effeminate Voice, and wrinkled Face, is not to be endured. It is impoſſible that Fellows of this Make can have Spirits neceſſary for the Beauty of Action; and indeed there is nothing more cold and feeble than the manner after which they act their Parts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:45740:118"/>There are at preſent Seven ſeveral O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera's at <hi>Venice;</hi> and one cannot chooſe but be there every Evening, if it were only but to find Company: But ſince you would have me ſpeak ingenuouſly, I I muſt tell you, that we impatiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the end of the Piece, before we have heard a quarter of it. You muſt know there is a Buffoon in every Opera: You may imagine what a Figure this Actor makes with his Fooleries in the moſt Serious, and even ſometimes moſt Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal part of the Play. I will ſay little of their Comedies; all the World knows they are but ridiculous Fuſtain, and wretched Buffooneries, ſcurvily performed. Nevertheleſs, let them be never ſo ſilly, there is always ſome Grimace, with ſome Poſture or Trick of <hi>Harlequin,</hi> that makes the Spectators laugh; the moſt luſcious Bawdy is pronounced in the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive terms, and the little Damſels of thoſe Societies never mince the matter. When they are juſt ready to begin, they commonly open the Doors for the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieurs, the Watermen, who make a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Body at <hi>Venice,</hi> and are vrey neceſſary Perſons. Their Office on this Occaſion is to clap their Hands, and bawl out like Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to give from time to time Applauſe to the Actors. I cannot either expreſs, or make you conceive what Terms they uſe when they congratulate the Women; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive alſo other Applauſes, by Sonnets made for them, and printed, which you
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:45740:119"/>
ſhall ſee fly from all ſides of the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre. Before I finiſh this Article, I muſt tell you, that theſe Theatres belong to ſome Noble-men, who get conſiderably by them, tho' they continue no longer than the Carnival laſts.</p>
                     <p>The places which they call <hi>Ridetti,</hi> are properly the Academies of <hi>Baſſet:</hi> They are open'd at the ſame time with the Theaters; there are none but Noble-men who cut. They diſmiſs the Gameſters when they pleaſe; and they have ſo much good Fortune joyn'd to their Privileges, and good Play, that the Bank is almoſt always Fortunate. There are Ten or Twelve Chambers on a Floor, with Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming-Tables in all of them. You can ſcarcely turn your ſelf in them; but tho' the Throng is ſo great, yet is there a profound Silence. To come into theſe places you muſt neceſſarily be mask'd. The Courteſans come thither in Shoals; and the other Ladies alſo, who under their Masks may enjoy all the publick Pleaſures of the Carnival; but they ſtill are follow'd by Spies, or by their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands. Beſides the Chambers of Play, there are ſome for Converſation, where they alſo ſell Liquors, Sweet-meats, and ſuch like things. They put not off their Masks; and by the Privilege of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, provided they be in good Cloaths, they may ſpeak to the Ladies, even to thoſe whom they may ſuppoſe of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Quality: But you muſt injure no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:45740:119"/>
Beſide that the Mask is Sacred, one will ſeem to take no notice, who hears all that is ſaid to his Wife, and who hath a great many <hi>Bravo's</hi> at his Heels, for by that name they call the Hectors and profeſs'd Murderers. Not that it is impoſſible to act a piece of Gallantry<note n="*" place="margin">In the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, it ſuffices at <hi>Venice</hi> to have good Breeding, and Money, and ſometimes to give a noble Treat. <hi>Anc. Deſ.</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                        </note> with the beſt guarded of them, when they are not over ſevere. As the Difficulty augments the Deſire, ſo this Deſire invents the Means; and thoſe who underſtand the Practiſe of this Country, will do more with the Wink of an Eye, than in other Countries we can perform by the longeſt Aſſiduities: But all theſe things are out of my Sphere, therefore I muſt beg your leave to go on.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt Maſquerading is in the place of St. <hi>Mark;</hi> where the Crowd is ſometimes ſo great, that one cannot turn himſelf: You may put your ſelf in what Equipage you pleaſe, but to do it well, you muſt be able to maintain the Perſonage you repreſent. Thus, for example, when the <hi>Harlequins</hi> meet, they jeer one another, and act a thouſand Fooleries. The Doctors diſpute. The Bullies vapour and ſwagger; and ſo of the reſt. Thoſe who are not willing to be Actors on this great Theatre, take the Habit of Noblemen. Some <hi>Polonian</hi> Dreſs, or the like, which obliges them to nothing. Maskers are not permitted to wear Swords. The Women are Habited as they pleaſe, and are to be ſeen there in moſt magnificent Dreſſes. In the mean time the place is
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:45740:120"/>
filled with Puppet-Plays, Rope-Dancers, and all ſorts of ſuch People as you ſee at <hi>Bartholomew-Fair.</hi> But thoſe which in my Opinion are the pleaſanteſt of all, are a kind of Almanack-makers and Fortune-tellers, who have their little Stages environ'd with Spheres, Globes, Aſtronomical Figures, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and Conjuring-Books of all ſorts: theſe Pronouncers of Oracles have a long Pipe of Tin, with which they ſpeak in the Ear of the Curious, who ſtand below the Scaffold. They ſpeak more or leſs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Perſons, and obſerve, without any notice taken, the Countenance of the Conſulter: when they perceive he Smiles, and by ſome other geſture denotes his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, they give over ſpeaking a little, and ring a little Bell with wondrous Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, to make known, that by virtue of their Art, they have dived into a very ſecret Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, or elſe that they have hit extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily right. When they ſwear only By <hi>God,</hi> it ſignifies nothing; that is only a common Road of ſpeaking, which no body regards. But when they would be believed, they call to witneſs the Saint of <hi>Padua,</hi> or the moſt bleſſed Lady of <hi>Loretto,</hi> and then all the ſtanders by look ſeriouſly and devoutly, and pull off their Hats, as when a Pſalm is ſung at the Gallows. It is pleaſant to ſee the Prieſts and the Monks of all Orders, who take up the <hi>Tubes</hi> three quarters of the time.</p>

This is what makes the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary greatneſs of the Arſenal, they have ſome Ships of War, of which the greateſt, which is called the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> hath, as they ſay, fourſcoure Pieces of Cannon mounted, and fourteen Pateraro's; it is at preſent at Sea.

                     <p>The Nobles never appear publickly at <hi>Venice,</hi> but in their Robes of black Cloth; theſe they wear at all times, and they ought to be lined with greyiſh Cloth in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Ermins in the Summer. The Stole is of the ſame Cloath. The Girdle is black alſo, four Fingers broad, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Plates and Buckles of Silver; and their Bonnet is only a kind of Cap of black Worſted, with a little Fringe of the ſame: But they wear great Perukes, and commonly carry their Cap in their hands. The Procurators of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> the <hi>Savii grandi,</hi> and the others, who are poſſeſs'd of the higheſt Offices, have Habits to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them. Thoſe amongſt the Nobles, who have been Ambaſſadors may wear a Stole of Cloath of Gold, and put Buckles of Gold to their Girdles: But ordinarily they only adorn their black Stoles with a little Gold Galloom. The Phyſicians, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates, Notaries, and all thoſe which are called <hi>Cittadini,</hi> are habited like the Nobles, without any diſtinction. It would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be pleaſing to theſe to be known by their Habits; for ſuch a diſtinction might expoſe them to great dangers, ſhould any diſorder happen. They cauſe themſelves to be treated with <hi>Excellency,</hi> and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to ſalute them with great ſubmiſſion is to kiſs their Sleeve. The Elbow of this Sleeve is like a great Sack, and into that,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:45740:127"/>
thoſe who go to Market put their Proviſion. They are not followed by any Servant, and no Perſon ſalutes them, but he who knows them, except thoſe who wear the ſame Robe. The People fear them and love them but little; but I will not ſay that this proceeds from any ill Treatment they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from them. Friendſhip grows com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly from Converſe; we may then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is becauſe the Nobles make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves familiar with no body. They dare not make themſelves popular, for fear leſt they ſhould be accuſed of Caballing againſt the State. This ſame reaſon hinders them to viſit each other; and renders them inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible to Foreigners. You muſt confeſs, that this ſavage and ſower Policy is very troubleſome. It is hard that a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be happy without deſtroying the bands and communications of Society, which are the chief Pleaſures of this Life! I muſt further tell you, on this Article, that the Nobility is not entail'd to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sons only, as in <hi>England.</hi> They are not permitted to Trade, nor to marry with Foreigners.</p>
                     <p>I am not ſurpris'd at the trouble thoſe Titles of Marqueſſes and Counts give you, which you hear ſpoken of in the Countries depending on <hi>Venice.</hi> I will explain the matter to you. The Noble <hi>Venetians</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be equal to Princes, but never qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie themſelves by any particular Title: And the Marqueſſes and Counts which you tell me of, are no Noblemen of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                        <pb n="204" facs="tcp:45740:128"/>
Theſe Gentlemen are of three ſorts; Some of them really enjoy'd theſe Dignities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they became Subjects to this State, but they have loſt the Priviledges of their Titles, and keep only the Name. They have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways taken care at <hi>Venice</hi> to humble them, and to take from them all means of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhake off the Yoke, or return under the Dominion of their ancient Maſters; and one of the ways which they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for this, hath been to create Counts of a new Stamp, who make head againſt the others, and ſo take away the diſtinction by a confuſion of Titles, which have the ſame ſound. The other advantages which <hi>Venice</hi> draws from this Invention, would make here too long a digreſſion; only I have inform'd you what are the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes and Counts of the ſecond Order. Thoſe of the third are founded on ſome Pretenſions of their Anceſtors. If they were not altogether Counts, in the time of the ancient Government, they had at leaſt a great deſire to be ſo. And when the face of Affairs was chang'd, they made themſelves Counts, I know not how, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any endeavours uſed to hinder them, becauſe they got no real advantage by it.</p>

                     <p>To return to the Duke: You muſt know, that notwithſtanding all his Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and his little Authority, his Quality of Duke allows him two or Three ſmall Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges. He hath two Voices in the great Council: He beſtows the little Offices of the Palace; and he hath the Nomination of the <hi>Primicerio,</hi> and Canons of St. <hi>Mark.</hi> As for his other Honours, they are given to the Republick, in the Perſon of the Duke. In this ſence he is call'd <hi>Prince,</hi> and treated with <hi>Serenity,</hi> which is a term of Honour above that of <hi>Highneſs,</hi> according to their Interpretation. There are ſome Marks of Royalty in his Apparel. When he marches in State, they carry a Torch
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:45740:130"/>
before him,<note n="*" place="margin">This Chair hath two Arms, and no Back.</note> a Folding Chair, the Cuſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which belongs to it, and Eight Silver Trumpets, ſome Hoboys, and Eight Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards, on which are the Arms of <hi>Venice:</hi> There are Two White, Two Red, Two Violet, and Two Blue, which, 'tis ſaid, ſignifie Peace, War, Truce, and the League. They made us take notice, that the Two Red ones marched firſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Republick was at preſent in War. When it was at Peace, the White ones have the precedency; and ſo the reſt in order. They carry alſo near the Duke, a kind of Cloth of State, made like an Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brello. The Duke is ordinarily accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and the other Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors which are at <hi>Venice,</hi> except the Ambaſſador of <hi>Spain,</hi> who never aſſiſts at any publick Ceremony, ſince this State gave the Precedency to the Ambaſſador of <hi>France.</hi> Theſe Miniſters have their Hats on their Heads. As for the Duke, he never pulls off his Coronet but on one of theſe two Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; either at the moment when the Hoſt is elevated, or when he receives a Viſit from a Prince of Royal Blood, or from a Cardinal. I muſt tell you, that the Cardinal ſits in the ſame great Chair with the Duke; this Chair having a Spring and Machine made on purpoſe to let it out ſo as Two may ſit together: The Duke gives the Right-hand to the Cardinal. But to return to the Proceſſion: The Principal Senators march after, and the Sword of State is carried before them, to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:45740:131"/>
denote that the Authority reſides in the Council, not in the Duke. I am not well enough inform'd of the particulars of the reſt of this Proceſſion, to give you an exact Deſcription of it; but it is not very material. I muſt farther acquaint you, that the Money bears the Name of the Duke: That the Letters of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Princes and States are addreſſed to him: That he gives Audience to Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, and that Declarations are publiſh'd in his Name. Theſe laſt Particulars need ſome Explanation: The Name of the Duke is, in truth, on the Money, but his Arms are not; and his Image is there only Hiſtorically. This Money is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Coin of <hi>Venice.</hi> On the Reverſe is the Duke on his Knees, at the Foot of the <hi>Primicerio,</hi> who ſits and repreſents St. <hi>Mark.</hi> The Duke takes an Oath of Fidelity to him, having one Hand on the Maſs-Book, and with the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Banner of the State. By this you may perceive that this is no Honour to the Duke; and that his Image has no more Marks of Authority than that of the <hi>Primicerio.</hi> As for the Letters of Princes, the truth is, they are directed and preſented to the Duke; but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to him to open them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out firſt communicating them to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; that is to ſay, the Council receives them by his Hands. And it is much the ſame thing with reſpect to Ambaſſadors; For the Affair is conſulted before, and the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:45740:131"/>
Anſwer is ſo well put, Word for Word, into the Mouth of the Duke, that if any of them happen to forget, or perhaps to make a willing Miſtake, they are aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to find themſelves corrected on the Spot. As to what concerns Acts of State, he is but tht Herald; the Senate enacts, and the Duke publiſhes.</p>
                     <p>It muſt then be confeſſed, that if in any caſe Gold and Purple are but glaring Page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants; and if the Grandeurs of the World are but Chimera's and ſtately Yokes; the Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> is an Eminent Inſtance of theſe Truths.</p>
                     <p>I have, in obedience to your Deſire, inſiſted the longer on this Particular: Do not think that I have reveal'd to you any Myſtery, in the things which I have ſaid of the Duke: Though they are not conformable to the <hi>Idea's</hi> you had conceiv'd, nor, perhaps, to thoſe of the greateſt part of the World; they are all generally known here.<note place="margin">See what Mr. <hi>Amelot</hi> hath written of it.</note> I will not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the Article of Government, that would be too tedious and difficult a Subject for me to undertake; who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have Time, nor Intelligence ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to be fully inſtructed in ſo many things.</p>
                     <p>I will briefly anſwer your Queſtions concerning the Patriarch. He is elected by the Senate, and confirmed by the Pope; and his Quality gives him, as you may believe, a very eminent Rank; but his Authority is extreamly bounded. The

It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo incredible how much Ignorance and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order reigns in this Country, among all thoſe who call themſelves Clergy-men. The Cardinal <hi>Barberigo,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Padua,</hi> who is a venerable Old Man, and a wiſe Perſon, ſometimes take the Pains, as they ſay at <hi>Padua,</hi> to preach himſelf againſt theſe Abuſes. He introduces as much as he can, the Cuſtom to make the Prieſts underſtand a little <hi>Latin.</hi> And his Zeal hath extended ſo far as to double the Grates of ſome Nunneries in his Dioceſs,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:45740:132"/>
in hopes they will follow his Example at <hi>Venice,</hi> where the Parlours, or Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-places are of too eaſie Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But all this produces but little; they do not willingly give Ear to ſuch Spoilers of good Company.</p>
                     <p>I muſt in the mean time tell you, that I remember a very pleaſant Secret which was found out here, in behalf of ſome Prieſts that are Muſicians. You know it is a Law without Exception, that a Prieſt muſt be a Compleat Man; nevertheleſs, it hath been obſerved, that this Perfection of the Body is ſometimes a cauſe of the Unpleaſantneſs of the Voice; and, on the other ſide, the Sweetneſs of the Voice is of great uſe to inſinuate <hi>things</hi> the better into the Minds of People, both in the Church, and at the Opera: They have found a Mean to accommodate the Affair, and have concluded that a Prieſt fitted for Muſick, may exerciſe the Prieſthood as well as another; provided he hath his <hi>Neceſſities,</hi> or, if you will, his <hi>Superfluities</hi> in his Pocket. I will not be bound to produce the Act for this Regulation, which certainly was only given <hi>vivâ voce.</hi> But let that be as it will, I can poſitively aſſure you from my own certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that what I have told you is Truth.</p>

                        <hi>Rovigo</hi> is a poor little City, begirt with a Wall juſt falling to ruine: Yet it is the Reſidence of the Biſhop of <hi>Adria.</hi> That ancient and famous City, which gave name to the Gulf, being now but a pitiful half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drowned Village.</p>

theſe old Princes are conſtrained to do a great deal of Work in a little time, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich their Families; they care little what becomes of the Eſtate after their Death.

                     <p>They carried us alſo to the Opera, where we ſaw nothing extraordinary. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Actreſs was a little pretty Songſtreſs, of Twelve or Thirteen Years old; who that day was to make the firſt Eſſay on the Theatre; and according to common Report, was that Evening to enter into the Service of one of the principal Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the City. All the chief Boxes were filled with <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and ſuch like People.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">RAVENNA.</note>It is fifty Miles from <hi>Ferrara</hi> to <hi>Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> the Way continues good for the firſt Day's Journey, but afterwards becomes low, and full of Water, between the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Branches of the <hi>Adige</hi> and the <hi>Po.</hi> The Towns and Villages which we ſaw on the Road, deſerve not to be mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>Ravenna</hi> is but half as big as <hi>Ferrara,</hi> yet it appears at a great diſtance, being ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated in a flat and open Champion Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. You are not ignorant that the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Geographers repreſent its Situation like to that of <hi>Venice,</hi> upon Piles in the midſt of Waters. And all the World knows that it was formerly<note n="*" place="margin">Claſſem My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeni alterum Ravennae ad tutelam ſuperi &amp; inferi ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. <hi>Suet. in Octav. c.</hi> 49.</note> the Principal Haven which the <hi>Romans</hi> had on the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Gulf: But this Place hath ſuffer'd great Alterations ſince thoſe times; for not only the <hi>Lagunes</hi> are dried up, but the Sea is alſo retired
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:45740:135"/>
Three Miles from it; and theſe Plains, formerly drown'd and barren, are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the moſt fruitful Fields in <hi>Italy.</hi> It is not to be doubted but that the preſent <hi>Ravenna</hi> is in the place of the ancient <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna;</hi> as it appears evidently from ſeveral ancient Monuments. There are in the Walls towards the Sea-ſide, many great Rings of Iron, which formerly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to faſten the Veſſels: And you may yet ſee the remainders of the Beacon. This City hath been ſo often ruin'd by the Wars, that there are but few Marks left of its firſt Antiquity: It is at preſent poorly built, and very thinly peopled, as well as <hi>Ferrara;</hi> nevertheleſs I found it in many things worthy of Obſervation. Its Situation alone, in reſpect of the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Change which hath happen'd in its Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, I think deſerves a Man's travelling this way.</p>
                     <p>Without the Walls, near the ancient Haven, there is a <hi>Mauſolaeum,</hi> which <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſuntha</hi> erected for her Father <hi>Theodoric,</hi> King of the <hi>Oſtrogoths;</hi> who, as you know, made his Reſidence at <hi>Ravenna.</hi> They have turned this Building into a little Church, which they call the <hi>Rotonda.</hi> The moſt remarkable thing about it is, the hewn Stone with which this Church is cover'd: I meaſured this Stone, and found it to be thirty eight Foot in Diameter, and fifteen in Thickneſs. The Tomb of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doric</hi> was on the top, in the midſt of this little Dome, between the Statues of the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:45740:136"/>
Twelve Apoſtles, which were placed on the ſides round about. Theſe Statues were broken during the laſt Wars of <hi>Louis</hi> XII. and the Tomb which is of <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> was alſo over-thrown: They have ſince ſet it in the Wall of an Ancient Palace in the City, where we ſaw it.</p>
                     <p>The Cathedral is an old Church, the Body of which is ſupported by fifty ſix Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Marble, of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> which make a double Range on each ſide. The Choir is vaulted with fine <hi>Moſaick;</hi> and they keep there in great Veneration, one of the Stones with which St. <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtoned. But the greateſt Curioſity in this Church is the great Door: It is made of Planks of Vines, ſome whereof are twelve Foot high, and fourteen or fifteen Inches broad. The Ground hereabouts is ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Vines, in that very place which the Sea formerly covered, that it makes them grow prodigiouſly big. I have read, as I remember, in the Voyage of <hi>Olearius,</hi> that he found near the <hi>Caſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Sea, the Bodies of Vines of the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Man.</p>
                     <p>They ſhew in the Church of the <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> a little Window over the great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, in the midſt of which is the Figure of a White Pigeon, which is placed there for a Memorial; that after the death of St. <hi>Apollinarius,</hi> firſt Biſhop of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> the Prieſts being aſſembled to chooſe his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, the Holy Ghoſt, as they ſay, came in at that Window in the Shape of a
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:45740:136"/>
Dove, and perch'd upon him who was to be Elected: They add, that the ſame thing happen'd Eleven times after, ſucceſſively; but ſince that time, they have done their Buſineſs without ſuper-natural aſſiſtance. <hi>Platina</hi> after <hi>Euſebius,</hi> tells the like Story of the Election of Pope <hi>Fabian.</hi>

                     <p>There are very fine Pieces of <hi>Marble</hi> and <hi>Porphyrie</hi> in the Churches of St. <hi>Vital,</hi> St. <hi>Apollinarius,</hi> St. <hi>Romualdus,</hi> and St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew;</hi> all theſe were brought from <hi>Greece,</hi> and probably during the time of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archie.</hi>

There are alſo to be ſeen the Ruiues of an Amphithea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, behind the Gardens of the <hi>Capuchins.</hi> And Five hundred Paces farther, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the City, there is a Tower of Brick, which was the <hi>Pharos</hi> of the ancient Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but the Sea is fallen back half a Mile from this Place, and the <hi>Pharos</hi> is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent encompaſſed with Gardens. <hi>P. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateſta</hi> finiſhed the Deſtruction of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, which was once accounted one of the beſt in <hi>Italy,</hi> to build the Church of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> with the Pieces of Marble which he took from thence. This Church, were it finiſh'd, might paſs for a fine Structure. They keep there a <hi>Noſtre-dame,</hi> which ſerves for nothing but to bring Rain, or ſtop it, when there is either too much or too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. She never is asked any thing but on one of theſe two Occaſions.</p>
                     <p>The Library of the Count <hi>de Gambalon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga</hi> is very numerous, but there are no Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities in it, if we may give credit to him who ſhowed it to us. They made us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in the midſt of the Market, a kind of Marble Pedeſtal, on which theſe words are engraved: <hi>Caius Caeſar Dict. Rubicone ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perato civili bell.

                     <p>Departing from <hi>Rimini,</hi> we march'd on the Downs for Fifteen Miles, between the Sea and the Fields. I obſerv'd as we paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

thro' the Village <hi>Catholica,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Catholica.</note> over the Portal of the great Church, an Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſays, That a Council of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, almoſt all <hi>Arrians,</hi> being aſſembled at <hi>Rimini,</hi> in the Year 359, the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox perform'd their Devotions in this Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, which hath ever ſince born the Name of <hi>Catholica.</hi> You know the Hiſtory of this Council, if it may be properly ſo call'd. We perceived Ten or Twelve Miles from thence, towards the <hi>Appennine,</hi> the City and Republick of <hi>Marin;</hi> on the top of a Mountain, at the Foot of which are the Limits of that State. This little Swarm of Bees hath maintained it ſelf very happily for many Ages; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expos'd to the Envy or Jealouſie of any of its Neighbours. It is about Six or Seven Miles from <hi>Catholica</hi> to <hi>Peſaro:</hi> All this Country is ſtrewed with fine Houſes, and is very pleaſantly cultivated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Peſaro</hi> is greater, better built,<note place="margin">PESARO.</note> neater and pleaſanter than <hi>Rimini:</hi> Its Situation is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſmall Aſcent, which gives it a purer Air, and better Light: Nothing can be more pleaſant than the little Hills which ſurround it: It is a delicate Mixture of Paſtures, Vineyards, and Orchards: The Olives are admirable; but the Figs in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and eſteem ſurpaſs all other Fruits: The Figs of <hi>Peſaro</hi> are famous over all <hi>Italy.</hi> The beſt Meat coſts not above three <hi>Bayoques</hi> the Pound, which is Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Ounces; that is to ſay, ſomewhat leſs than two Farthings. The Bread and the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:45740:139"/>
Wine are proportionably cheaper; and ſo of the reſt. The Sea and the Rivers furniſh it alſo with all ſorts of excellent Fiſh; ſo that in all reſpects this City is excellently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with all things neceſſary for Life. It is tolerably well fortified, tho' ſomething after the old faſhion; and the Houſes are generally handſome. We found no old Monuments in it. There is a very fair Fountain in the great <hi>Place;</hi> and a Statue of Pope <hi>Urban</hi> VIII. under whoſe Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, this City, and all the Dutchy of <hi>Urbin,</hi> were re-united to the Eccleſiaſtical State.</p>
                     <p>At our departure from <hi>Peſaro,</hi> we coaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along the Shore for Seven Miles, as far as <hi>Fano:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">FANO.</note> It continues, ſtill as I repreſented it on the other ſide of <hi>Rimini,</hi> excepting that the Sea brings thither great Heaps of Walnuts, Cheſnuts, Ruſhes, Leaves, and divers other things which probably come from the Rivers, and are driven back from time to time by the Wind. One of our Company found on the <hi>Strand</hi> one of thoſe little Fiſhes which they call in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <hi>Cavaletto;</hi> ſome call it in <hi>France, Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Marin,</hi> or the Sea-Horſe; and others the <hi>Little Dragon.</hi> I have often ſeen it in the Cabinets of Curioſities; and I believe you alſo know it. It becomes drie in a little time, by which means it is eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, without farther trouble. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this little Creature hath ſomething of the Head and Neck of a Horſe. They at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute many Properties to it; and they
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:45740:139"/>
aſſured us, amongſt other things, that it cures Madneſs from biting by a Mad-Dog, being eaten roaſted, and applied to the bitten place, skinned and beaten with Honey and Vinegar.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fano</hi> is a pretty little City: We found nothing remarkable in it but one Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal-Arch; the Inſcriptions of which are almoſt quite defaced. This Arch hath Three Gates, whereas that of <hi>Rimini</hi> is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſingle Arch. They boaſt of the Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts of <hi>Fano;</hi> and pretend that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men there are the handſomeſt of all the Country; but I fanſie this pretended dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference may be a little ſuſpected.</p>
                     <p>A Mile from hence, we paſſed on a Wooden Bridge, about Five or Six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Paces long, over the ſeveral Branches of the <hi>Pongio,</hi> which drowns all this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, when the Snow on the <hi>Appennine</hi> begins to melt: And afterwards we took the Way on the Sea ſide, for Fifteen Miles, to <hi>Senegallia.</hi> Tho' this be an old City,<note place="margin">SENEGAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA.</note> yet could we find no Marks of its Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; it is encloſed with good Walls, which are defended by ſome Baſtions, but all very irregular.</p>
                     <p>By good fortune, and rather becauſe of our wearineſs than any thing elſe, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to go to ſee a Play, which was act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Governour's Houſe. The next Morning, which was the Day before Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, they came to tell us, that a little before the end of the Play, the Arch which ſupported the Theatre, with part of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:45740:140"/>
the Stage, and the firſt Seats, fell under the weight with which it was over-loaded: That thirty Perſons were killed on the ſpot, and a great many others wounded; and all that little City was in a great diſorder, and unſpeakable affliction on this occaſion: There ſcarcely being any conſiderable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily which had not its ſhare of this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.</p>
                     <p>Departing from <hi>Senegallia,</hi> we entred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain on the Shore, and travelled ſeventeen Miles, without finding any Houſes but an old Caſtle, and ſome Taverns about an hundred paces from the Sea. Near the little Village called the Turret, we fell back into the Land-way for three Miles to <hi>Ancona,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">ANCONA.</note> where we now are. This City is ſeated on a double Hillock, at the point of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory. It is bigger than any one of the four or five Towns laſt mention'd, but not much richer; though its Haven be very good,<note place="margin">Traders of all Religions may dwell at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cona,</hi> provided they make no publick Exerciſe of any, beſides the Religion of the Country. They whiten Wax very well at <hi>Ancona. Du Val.</hi>
                        </note> and the Country about it very fruitful. It is a wonderful thing that the Trade is quite ruin'd, in a place which was formerly ſo famous for it.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, that after the like example of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> we ought not to be ſurpris'd at any accidents of this nature. The Streets of <hi>Ancona</hi> are narrow, and conſequently dark: There are neither fair Houſes, fine Churches, nor conſiderable Places in it; and its ſituation, up Hill and down Hill, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:45740:140"/>
it very inconvenient. The Citadel, which is on the firſt aſcent you come to, commands both the City and the Haven. And on the other Hill which makes the point of the Cape, is the Church of St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack,</hi> to which we aſcended with a great deal of trouble and little ſatisfaction. It is a low and dark Edifice, of which the Front is cover'd indeed with fine Marble, but without any order or ornament of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture. That which is principally eſteem'd in this Church by the People of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, are the Bodies of the pretended Saints, and the number of Relicks. They boaſt they have St. <hi>Urſula,</hi> as well as thoſe of <hi>Cologne.</hi> As for us, what pleaſed us beſt, was the proſpect which we had of the Sea, of the City, and of a pleaſant Country. At the entrance of the Mote there is a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal-Arch of very fine white Marble. This Arch was erected for <hi>Trajan,</hi> by order of the Senate. The Inſcription, which is ſtill very entire, let us know, that it was in acknowledgment of this, that that Prince repair'd the Harbour at his own charge. They told us, whilſt we were conſidering this Monument, that, I know not what Monks had oftentimes earneſtly requeſted, that they might employ the Materials for ſome uſe in their Convent: And that at laſt they were fain to drive them away with Threats, to be rid of their Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
                     <p>The Exchange where the Merchants meet, reſembles a Portico of a reaſonable
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:45740:141"/>
bigneſs. There were at the four Corners of the Arch, four Statues, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented Faith, Hope, Charity, and Religion. But there happen'd an Earthquake ſome Years ſince, which ſhook all theſe Statues, and threw down that of Religion.</p>
                     <p>I cannot forbear giving you ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Habits, which, thanks to the Holy-day, we ſaw here to day. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Burgeſſes uſually wear a black Cloak, lined with green; blue or fillamott Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Shoes whited with Chalk, and tied with coloured Ribbon; the Doublets un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>button'd, adorn'd with Embroidery of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Colours, and great Sleeves to their Shirts, which hang down to their Fingers ends. The ordinary Citizens Wives and Daughters wear a kind of Coif on their Heads, with a long Fringe which covers their Faces, and drives away the Flies like Horſe-trappings. The body of their Gown is red or yellow, faſtned on four ſides with Laces, and all overlaid with coloured Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loon: The Waſtcoat ſhort, their Petticoats of the ſame ſize, and all of fifty Colours: The great Madams are deck'd and trimm'd up as much as they can after the <hi>French</hi> Mode: But to ſay truth, their Apiſhneſs is more ridiculous than the others natural Dreſſing. All this does neither good nor hurt; but there is another Cuſtom which, as we were inform'd, runs from <hi>Ferrara</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all over <hi>Italy,</hi> and is very inconvenient, eſpecially at this time of the Year. They know not what Glaſs is, and their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Windows
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:45740:141"/>
are made of Linen or Paper, always torn; ſo that they are fain ro invent Machines every Evening, to ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Weather. This made us ſometimes bewail the loſs of our Straw in <hi>Germany,</hi> where, if we wanted Beds, we had at leaſt a good Stove, well heated and cloſed. To compleat our Misfortunes, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly brought us a Fricacy of three Eggs, or as many Pilchards, for the Supper of five or ſix Perſons. You muſt Fight for your Victuals, and yet pay as much as for the beſt Cheer.

Nature her-ſelf leaped for Joy, and the very Oaks of the Foreſt, bowed themſelves to pay Homage to it; they wanted only Tongues like thoſe of <hi>Dedona.</hi> After this Houſe had been there Eight Months entire, it was diſpleaſed with the Thieveries and Murders committed thereabouts continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſo that it was carried the third time a
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:45740:143"/>
Mile further to the ſame Hill, on which it now ſtands: but it was no ſooner come thither, than a Controverſie aroſe between two Brothers to whom the Land belonged, each being willing to have it in his Lot. This was the cauſe, that four Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the Angels lifted it up the fourth time, and placed it ſome paces from thence, in the very midſt of the Road-way; from whence it hath never ſtirred ſince. It is true, to prevent the inconveniencies to which this place, as well as the others, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it, and perhaps alſo to prevent the misfortune of a new change: They built in this very place a magnificent Church, in the midſt whereof it remains free from all manner of Inſults or Injury. And for its better preſervation, they have ſince e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected four Walls, which encompaſs it, and cloſe it up as in a Box, without touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it at all, for fear, leſt the two Walls being united, they ſhould one day be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded together. Some alledge another reaſon of this Seperation; and ſay, That the Stones recoiled with violence, and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Work-men, when they would have joined it to this Holy Building; ſo that they were conſtrained to leave ſome ſpace between them. All the beauties of Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, Sculpture, and Architecture, were diſplay'd on that occaſion; or at leaſt all the moſt curious Workmen in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the laſt Age, were employed in this Work. It is of <hi>Corinthian</hi> Order, and of white Marble of <hi>Carrara,</hi> with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:45740:143"/>
fine <hi>Baſſo relievo's,</hi> in which all the Hiſtory of the Virgin is repreſented: There are alſo two Niches, the one above the other, between the double Columns. In the ten Niches below, are the Statues of the ten Prophets, and in the Niches above, the ten <hi>Sybils.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is within this that the <hi>Santa Caſa</hi> is enclos'd, which conſiſts of one only Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or rather one ſingle Hall. It is forty four Palms long within, eighteen broad, and thirteen high; a Palm and an half making juſt thirteen Inches, <hi>Engliſh</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                     <p>They would have thoſe very People who live on the place, believe, that this Houſe is built of ſome unknown Stones, to make its Voyages ſeem more probable; but this is an abſurdity that can only be ſwallow'd by ſuch as are willing to be deceiv'd. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd the thing twice very nearly, and at leiſure. 'Tis true, they have purpoſely made choice of Bricks of different ſhapes and unequal bigneſs, yet I perceiv'd very diſtinctly, that theſe Walls are made of Brick, and true Brick; together with ſome flat and greyiſh or reddiſh Stones, which are all common. The whole is built with Lime and Sand, as our ordinary Houſes, but the Pieces are ill joyned, and ill ranged, which ſeems to evince, that this work was done in haſte.</p>
                     <p>I will here make a little digreſſion, to acquaint you with a thought which comes in my Head concerning it. It was under
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:45740:144"/>
the Popedom of <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. that this pretended Miracle happen'd<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <p>It is he who, they ſay, rais'd himſelf to the Papal Dignity like a Fox, liv'd like a Lion, and dy'd like a Dog.</p>
                           <p>It was he who invented, and firſt wore the Triple Crown. <hi>Intravit ut vulpes, reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navit ut leo, mortuus ut canis.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </note>. And if you make any reflection on the Life of that famous <hi>Fox,</hi> which all Hiſtories repreſent to us as the moſt Cunning, the moſt Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, and moſt Covetous of all the Men in the World, and add to theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that of his Power and Authority, you will grant, without difficulty, that he was a Man fit to undertake ſuch a Cheat as this: After he had feigned Angels who frighted the good Man <hi>Celeſtin,</hi> his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, and obliged him to return to his Hermitage, after his Abdication of the Popedom: And it is not at all improbable, that he made uſe of the ſame Angels for the Expedition of <hi>Loretto.</hi> But let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the <hi>Santa Caſa.</hi>

                     <p>On each ſide of the Niche, there are Preſſes full of ancient Ornaments of the Statue; and in the other little Window, which is made in the Wall on the <hi>South</hi> ſide, they preſerve ſome earthen Diſhes, which ſerv'd for the uſe of the Holy Family. There are many of theſe Veſſels which have been ſince cover'd with Plates of Gold; but we could ſee but one of 'em, which is cover'd underneath with Silver. They would make us believe, that this Porringer, which might have been diſcover'd by the bottom, is made of ſtrange Earth, but it is Potter's-Ware, the Enamel of which is not ſo carefully par'd off, but that it appears ſtill in ſome parts. Over againſt our Lady, at the end which looks <hi>Weſtward,</hi> is the Window at which they ſay the Angel entred. This Window ſeemed to me about three foot in heighth, and a little leſs in breadth.</p>

                        <pb n="236" facs="tcp:45740:146"/>They could not tell me what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the old Roof, nor the little Bell, which hath been obſerved in the ancient Pictures which repreſent this Houſe: For the preſent Arch is of a later Fabrick. As for Bells they have ſome, and their proper uſe ſhould be to appeaſe Storms immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with their ſound; but they never uſe them for fear of wearing them.</p>
                     <p>I muſt not forget two conſiderable things, which, they ſay, were tranſported at the ſame time with the Houſe: the Altar made by the hands of the Apoſtles themſelves, and the Stone on which St. <hi>Peter</hi> celebrated his firſt Maſs. This is covered with Silver, and hath place among the Relicks, under the Altar where they uſually officiate. The Pavement is of ſquares of white and red Marble. This is not the old Floor, for, they ſay, the Angels left that at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> with the Foundations of the Houſe. To prove this Hiſtory of the Tranſlation, they inſiſt on this Argument, that, as they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, it appears, that it really hath no Foundation, but was fixed on the Earth, juſt as it fell from Heaven.</p>

The laſt rich Offering is always left for ſome time in a place fram'd on purpoſe, before the Eyes of our Lady: That which at preſent occupies that honourable place, is an Angel of Gold, holding a Heart bigger than an Egg, all covered over with Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds of great value. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Jeſuite who conducted us, told us, it was a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Queen of <hi>England.</hi> This Reverend Father alſo told us a great piece of News, concerning which, you ought, in my Opinion, to have given us ſome account. He aſſured us, that Princeſs was big with Child, and added, that undoubtedly it was by Miracle; ſince they had calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the very moment in which the

Preſent entred, was the happy Minute in which ſhe Conceived.</p>

                     <p>Never were Verſes repeated with a more luſcious Tune, or pleaſant Air. The Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits Companion thought them ſo well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd, that he humbly begg'd a Repiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:45740:147"/>
though he knew them already by Heart: And this favour was preſently granted him. My ſmiling Countenance ſeemed alſo to applaud them, but my ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence did not pleaſe the Reverend Father. He ſuſpected there was ſomething which I diſlik'd, and entreated me ſo earneſtly to tell him my Thoughts, that I could not poſſibly refuſe him. At firſt, I prais'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Paſſages of them, as the <hi>foecundo fonte,</hi> fruitful Spring, which the Angel begg'd, and the <hi>Dat, petit amplexus,</hi> which appear'd to me very ſignificant. Yes, ſaid he, the manner of expreſſing the thing, is not leſs ſweet and fine, than emphatical and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative; for it denotes a mutual fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency. I added, that ſince he permitted me to ſpeak freely, I could not forbear tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that the beginning of the ſeventh Verſe offended me as much as that of the twelfth ſeemed excellent; that the <hi>Uterus (Womb)</hi> of which he ſpake, needed no culture, according to all outward Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances; that ſuch an Epithet was injurious to her Royal Spouſe; and, in a word, that I could by no means endure the Word <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culti, Untilled,</hi> which beſides did not well expreſs his thought. At firſt he would have defended himſelf, but he ſubmitted at laſt; and it was concluded, that inſtead of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culti miſerere uteri,</hi> it ſhould henceforth be, <hi>O humilem ſpectes uterum,</hi> or ſomething to that purpoſe. I would have paſt over the <hi>Vale,</hi> but he confeſs'd, of his own accord, that he put it there only to fill a Gap. He
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:45740:148"/>
admired the <hi>Alleluja</hi> beyond meaſure, and imagin'd, he could never have made a more happy concluſion. It is true, ſaid I, <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luja</hi> is an angelical Word, it is an exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Praiſe and Joy, which comes very ſeaſonably where you have plac'd it: But you muſt remember, added I, that the three firſt Syllables of <hi>Alleluja</hi> are long, whereas you have made it a Dactyle, and this <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word is written in <hi>Greek,</hi>

                        <hi>Prudentius,</hi> who had made it ſhort, notwithſtanding the <hi>Greek</hi> η, which ſignified little, the Word being <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> and confeſſed the <hi>Penultima</hi> was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally long. But he concluded, that the beauty of a thought might excuſe the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of ſuch niceties of quantity; and he reſolved at any rate to keep his <hi>Alleluja.</hi> We had already alter'd our Diſcourſe, when the young Brother deſired permiſſion to cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſe on the <hi>Natum</hi> of the fifteenth Verſe. He ſaid, the Son was not yet born, and therefore ought not be called <hi>Natum:</hi> And that he could not think it poſſible, the Name <hi>Natus</hi> or <hi>Filius</hi> ſhould be given to an Embryo of half a Minute, or at leaſt to the informed matter of a <hi>Foetus.</hi> But the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Poet laugh'd at him for this, and told him, that the Word of the moſt Holy Lady was a ſure Word; that <hi>Born</hi> or <hi>to be Born,</hi> ſignified the ſame thing on this occaſion; that it was properly a Queſtion of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and that we may ſpeak of things that will infallibly happen, as of thoſe that are
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:45740:148"/>
already in Being. The Fryar had yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Objection to make againſt <hi>Natum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi> but he only mutter'd a little, ſaying, there never was <hi>Natus foemina,</hi> for he was afraid of giving Offence: And thus ended our Conference.</p>
                     <p>There are a great number of Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, with Branches and other Luminaries, all round the Houſe without, that is, round the Walls which encloſe it. But one of the greateſt Rarities we obſerv'd, was the Proceſſions of thoſe who ſurround this Houſe on their Knees, ſome compaſs it five times, others ſeven, and ſome twelve, according to the Myſtery they ſearch for in the number. Repreſent to your ſelf forty or fifty Perſons, Men, Women, and little Children, all creeping on their Knees, as they turn from one ſide, and a like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber meeting them, as they go to the other; every one is furniſh'd with Beads, and mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles <hi>Pater-noſters:</hi> in the mean time they all ſtrive to creep next the Wall, both to ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their way, and to be neareſt to the <hi>Holy Place;</hi> which makes them joſtle each other, and cauſes no ſmall confuſion. This is never done, but when there is but a little Company there. The great reſort of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims is at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and about the Feſtival of the Virgin's Nativity, which they ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize in the Month of <hi>September;</hi> at which times they are obliged to take other Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. I cannot, without reluctancy, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a thing, which may ſeem incredible, yet is affirmed by them for a certain Truth;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:45740:149"/>
which is, That in the Years of the greateſt Concourſe, they have ſeveral times count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two hundred thouſand Pilgrims and upwards, during theſe two Feaſts.</p>
                     <p>One can ſcarcely imagine a pleaſanter ſight, than the Caravans of He and She Pilgrims, when theſe Caravans come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as bodies of Confraternities: Many Societies of <hi>Bologna,</hi> for Example, join to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to go on Pilgrimage in Company. Each Society have their<note n="*" place="margin">Saccola.</note> Frocks of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Linen-Cloth, with a Cowl of the ſame Linen, made like a Strainer for <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocras,</hi> which quite covers their Heads, and leaves only three Holes for their Eyes and Mouth. There are Fraternities of all Colours: They forget not their Beads, Girdles, Pilgrims Staves, and the Arms of the Society, which are painted, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered, before and behind, on the Back and Breaſt of every Brother. Theſe Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims thus equipped, ride upon Aſſes, which are reputed to have ſome ſmack of Sanctity, by often going on Pilgrimage. They ſeldom fall; and if they happen to do ſo, they ſay 'tis without danger to the Pilgrim. So much for the Men. The Womens Habits are as rich as poſſibly they can procure: And they fix to the Body of their Gowns, a little Pilgrim's Staff, of the length of a Hand<note n="†" place="margin">Some are of Gold, Silver, Ebony, Ivory, Artificial Flowers, and many are enriched with Pearls, and Precious Stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> A Staff, which gives occaſion for many pleaſant Thoughts, and ſerves for Diverſion to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:45740:149"/>
all the Company on the Way. Theſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of Ladies ride in Calaſhes, ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with whole Squadrons of Aſs-Troopers. Is it not pretty to ſee theſe Morrice-Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers thus mounted and dreſſed, make an hundred Rounds, and Antick Poſtures, accompanied with fooliſh Songs to divert the Lady Pilgrims? Let not this Liberty of the Women ſurprize you. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Devotion to our moſt holy Lady, is a Reaſon ſufficient to releaſe them from their uſual Priſons: And beſides, I doubt not but every one hath a Brother, or ſome other Spy near her.</p>
                     <p>I might tell you a great many things of the Church, but I fear you are cloy'd with ſuch Stories: Only you muſt know, that all that is rich in the Houſe is but of ſmall value, in compariſon of what we ſaw in the Treaſury-Chamber. This Chamber is a ſpacious place: Ten great Preſſes, with folding-Doors, ſerve as Wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcot to the Walls; the vaulted Roof is of a fine ſort of Plaiſter, with gilded Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, adorn'd with fine Pictures. The Silver-work is not thought worthy of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into the Preſſes; it was allowed at the firſt, but at preſent it is confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly heaped up in private places, till they have occaſion to uſe it. Theſe Preſſes are therefore filled only with pure Gold, remarkable Jewels, or Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Ornaments more precious than
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:45740:150"/>
Gold<note n="*" place="margin">Among theſe Jewels, they ſet the higheſt eſteem on a Pearl wrought after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of a <hi>Gondola;</hi> which they ſay was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally mark'd with the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of our Lady. <hi>B. Bartoli.</hi>
                        </note>: I will not attempt a Relation of the Particulars, for they exceed Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination it ſelf. To comprehend how theſe vaſt Riches were thus accumulated, you need only remember, that all the People, Princes and States, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Supremacy of the Pope, have continually for theſe four hundred Years brought them thither, and vied to out-do each other: You muſt alſo conſider, that this Treaſure is but a ſmall part of the Preſents they have received. They have built a Church, and a moſt magnificent Palace. They have ſettled Revenues, and purchaſed Lands beyond all view; and it is not to be doubted but they have Cheſts full of Money. This is not all; the Boxes furniſh them with prodigious Sums, and one of the Secrets they make uſe of, to ſtir up the Devotees to fill them, I think very well deſerves a Relation. They diſtribute a Printed Paper, by which they endeavour to perſwade the People, that the <hi>Holy Houſe</hi> hath no more than twenty ſeven thouſand Crowns in Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue;<note place="margin">The Crown is worth near Five Shillings Six Pence <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Money.</note> and by another Computation which they annex to the former, they ſhow, that they are obliged to disburſe thirty eight thouſand ſix hundred and thirty four Crowns, to pay the Officers Salaries, and other Annual Expences. See then above eleven thouſand Crowns, which according to this pretended Account, they fall ſhort every Year. This is a ready way to take Opportunity to make pathetick Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:45740:150"/>
of their Poverty, and to move the Compaſſion of devout Pilgrims, in favour of our good Lady, who, ſay they, loves nothing more than the Vertue of Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</p>
                     <p>As we left the Treaſury, they carried us to the Arſenal, which is not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: There they ſhewed us ſome Arms taken from the <hi>Turks,</hi> and relate, that theſe Barbarians having made a Deſcent to plunder the Treaſury,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mahomet II.</hi> and after him <hi>Selim</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew.</note> about fifty Years ago, our Lady ſtruck them all blind juſt at the very Entrance; at which time they ſeized on part of their Arms. From the Windows of this Arſenal, you behold the part of the Sea, over which, as they ſay, the Houſe was brought: They add, that ever ſince, there is a certain White Way on the Water; and our Jeſuit made uſe of the higheſt Aſſeverations, to proteſt to us, that he had often ſeen it. Yeſterday when we came hither, the Rabble flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about us, and told us, That we muſt make haſte to confeſs and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; without which, thoſe who ſhould dare to enter into the <hi>Holy Houſe,</hi> would be ſhaken even to the Marrow in their Bones, and be in danger of ſudden death. There muſt be as well Impudence on one ſide, on ſuch Occaſions, as there is a great deal of Prejudice and Stupidity on the other.</p>
                     <p>After we had ſeen ſome Apartments of the Palace, they led us into the Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, where we found one hundred and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:45740:151"/>
forty great Tuns, full of good Wine. From thence we went to the place where the Drugs were kept; where they ſhew'd us three hundred and forty five Veſſels of Earthen-Ware, which they ſaid were painted by <hi>Raphael,</hi> and are infinitely eſteemed. On five of the largeſt, are St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the four Evangeliſts; and on the others, the Hiſtory of the Saints, the Metamorphoſes of <hi>Ovid,</hi> and Plays of Children.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Loretto</hi> is a very little Place, though it be well fortified, and hath the Title of a City and Biſhoprick.

                        <note place="margin">RECANATI.</note> which is a little City on the top of a Hill, three Miles from <hi>Loretto,</hi> I alighted for a while to ſee the great Church: I diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing there worthy of Obſervation, but the Tomb of poor <hi>Gregory</hi> XII. Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> who, as you know, was depoſed from the Pontificate by the Council of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa;</hi> together with <hi>Peter de Luna,</hi> who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd the Name of <hi>Benedict</hi> XIII. and was Pope of <hi>Avignon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ten Miles from thence, in a moſt fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Country, on the Bank of the <hi>Potenza,</hi> we paſt thro' the Ruines of the City for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly called <hi>Helvia Ricina,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">HELVIA RICINA.</note> where there are yet to be ſeen great Fragments of an Amphitheatre, which was built of Stone

and Brick mingled together, like that of <hi>Rimini.</hi> On this ſide the River, we were encloſed among Hills for two Miles, after which we arrived at <hi>Macerata,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">MACERATA</note> where we lay. They told us this City was indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently large, and very pleaſant; but it was late, and beſides foul Weather, ſo that we walked not abroad.

                        <hi>Tolentino</hi> is ſeated on a Riſing Ground; I could not learn there was any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable there, but ſome Relicks, which are things that we take little notice of. From thence we came to the Town of <hi>Belfort,</hi> which I may tell you, by the bye, is the firſt place built with Stone which we had ſeen in Italy. A good Mile on this ſide, we came into the Province of <hi>Umbria,</hi> where we began to enter into the Confines of the <hi>Appennine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of the Neighbourhood, who was going to <hi>Foligno,</hi> our way, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted us near to <hi>Macerata.</hi> I was glad of his Company, hoping to get information of ſeveral things relating to the Country; we preſently diſcourſed of our famous La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, of whom he related a hundred Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The Diſcourſe being turned to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, he told me, amongſt other things,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:45740:152"/>
that there was great rejoycing in <hi>Italy,</hi> that our King was become a Chriſtian: when I deſired him to explain his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I found he had ſo many ſtrange Notions, as I thought it impoſſible for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſon to conceive. The Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies he accuſed us of, were no leſs than thoſe which the <hi>Pagans</hi> laid to the charge of the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians.</hi> He would ſometimes look upon me with ſome ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, when I ſaid any thing which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him: but he ſtill ſuſpected that I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled; and all my Rhetorick could not perſuade him we were chriſtned.</p>
                     <p>You muſt know that this is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Opinion of this Country. They know no more of our Religion than they who live among the <hi>Tobinambouz.</hi> But thoſe Gentlemen of the Frock, who are beſt acquainted with News, think it meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſcandalize us, and render us odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, by the Follies and Impieties they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to us.</p>
                     <p>Between <hi>Tolentino</hi> and <hi>Foligno,</hi> for near forty Miles, we were almoſt always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Rocks, which made the ways often difficult. The principal Villages which we ſaw in our Paſſage, are <hi>Valcima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, Ponte di trava, Mutia, Dignano, Colfiorito,</hi> and <hi>Caſa Nuova.</hi> At our leaving the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, near to a little Village called <hi>Pala,</hi> we diſcovered from a height, the Plain of <hi>Foligno,</hi> which from thence makes one of the fineſt Proſpects in the World.<note place="margin">Hic ver Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duum. Virg.</note> This great Bottom is encompaſſed with rich Hillocks, watered
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:45740:153"/>
with many Rivers, ſtrewed with many pleaſant Houſes, and extraordinarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. We had ſcarcely eſcaped from the Snows, the Rocks, and the cold and piercing Winds, but on a ſudden we found our ſelves fanned by the Air of a ſweet Climate. The Almond-Trees were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy bloſſom'd, which in a moment ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the Froſts of the Mountains: This, added to the Beauty of a fair and calm Day, gave us the delicious Proſpect of a fine Summer. We could not give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver contemplating this delicate Garden, whoſe extraordinary Charms deſerved the higheſt Praiſes.</p>
                     <p>After we had inſenſibly jogged on three or four Miles in a continual deſcent, we came into a ſtreight and level Way, on the ſide whereof runs a ſmall River ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly clear;<note place="margin">FOLIGNO.</note> and we arrived at <hi>Folig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> which is but a Mile farther, at the end of this way. Though this City be ſeated in a Terreſtrial Paradiſe, it has nothing elſe conſiderable: Yet they ſay, that Trade flows thither more abundantly than to moſt of the other Cities of the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical State which we have ſeen. Their Trade conſiſts in Draperies, Gold and Silver Lace, ſome Silks, and Spicery. The <hi>Goths</hi> plunder'd it ſeveral times; and there are no old Monuments remaining.</p>
                     <p>A little while after we left <hi>Foligno,</hi> we ſaw on the other ſide of the Plain, upon an Eminence, the Town of <hi>Montefalco,</hi> where the miraculous <hi>S. Clara</hi> lies enterred.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:45740:153"/>
They ſhow there, as they told us, three Stones about the bigneſs of ſmall Nuts, which were found in the<note n="*" place="margin">They ſhow all the Inſtruments of the Paſſion, which are found there with the Stones.</note> Heart of that Saint, and upon which the Hiſtory of the Paſſion is engraved. But that which is moſt admirable, is, that all the three Stones together, weigh no more than one of 'em ſingly; and conſequently one weighs as much as all the three:</p>
                     <p>Not far from thence is the City of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſa,</hi> where they keep the Bones of that Saint, who preached to the Swallows, and made himſelf a Wife and whole Family of Snow; and whoſe Legend is ſtored with Fables. You know the Man.<note n="‖" place="margin">They pretend that his Body, and that of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> are ſide by ſide ſtanding on their Feet. At <hi>Porciuncula,</hi> five Miles from hence, they boaſt to have the firſt of theſe Saints, (St. <hi>Francis</hi>); and at the great Convent of <hi>Bologna</hi> they affirm alſo they have the Body of St. <hi>Dominick.</hi>
                        </note> His Relicks are under the great Altar of the Cathedral; but no living Soul is permitted to ſee them. It is ſaid, that a certain Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the Iſle of <hi>Corſica,</hi> who believed himſelf to have a greater Privilege than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, about ſixty Years ago, obſtinately reſolved to ſee them, and that by Divine Permiſſion, he was preſently ſtruck with ſudden Death. It is true, ſo much inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion was made to this Saint, that a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after the Prelate came to life again.</p>
                     <p>Near the Village of <hi>Peſignano,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Foligno</hi> and <hi>Spoletto,</hi> and at the Foot of the Hill which ſurrounds the Plain, a plentiful Spring runs out of four Outlets under a Rock, and inſtantly
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:45740:154"/>
makes a little Lake. There the four Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets being united, make from thence a pleaſant River, which afterwards forms an infinity of Meanders; which, without doubt, contribute very much to the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs as well as Ornament of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try it waters. About two hundred Paces from this Spring, there is on the Way-ſide, a very little Temple of <hi>Corinthian</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. One who ſeem'd to have ſome skill in Antiquity, told me at <hi>Spoletto,</hi> that this little River is the <hi>Clitumnus,</hi> ſpoken of by ſome ancient Authors, and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by <hi>Virgil</hi> in the Second Book of his <hi>Georgicks:</hi> and the Reaſons alledged for this Opinion ſeem very probable. But that which the vulgar Opinion adds, that the little Temple, conſecrated to <hi>Clitumnus,</hi> was made a Deity, is a Story without any appearance of Truth. For beſides that this Temple is built Croſs-wiſe, and <hi>Eaſtward,</hi> as the moſt part of the Chriſtian Churches are; and that there are Croſſes carved in divers places of the Pediments, which agrees not with the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Paganiſm:</hi> The three following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions are engraved on the Friſes of the Front, and on both ſides. (1) <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> 
                        <hi>S C S Deus Profetarum qui fecit Redimptionem.</hi> (2) <hi>Deus Angelorum qui fecit Reſurrectionem.</hi> (3) <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> 
                        <hi>S C S Deus Apoſto</hi> * * * *, the reſt is broken off. The Characters are not in the leaſt <hi>Gothick,</hi> nor any other part of the Architecture. Perhaps this Temple was built out of the Ruines of that of <hi>Clitum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
                        <pb n="253" facs="tcp:45740:154"/>
It is now call'd <hi>S. Salvatore;</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Spoletto</hi> ſays Maſs there once a year.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Peſignano</hi> to <hi>Spoletto,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">SPOLETTO.</note> which is but ſeven Miles, you coaſt the plain Country at the foot of the Hills; there are in all theſe Parts a conſiderable number of Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages and Houſes, ſcatter'd here and there. <hi>Spoletto</hi> lies within the Mountain, over the rich Plain which I deſcrib'd before. It is a poor City, thinly peopled, ill built, and in a very uneven Situation. They carried us to the Cathedral, after they had boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much of the height of the Body of the Church; but after all, we found nothing extraordinary in its height. The Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is made of little Pieces of Marble, inlaid, like the Church of St. <hi>Mark</hi> at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice;</hi> and all the Pediment of the great Portal, is fine <hi>Moſaick,</hi> on a Golden Ground. From thence we went to the Caſtle, which is in the higheſt place of the City. It is only ſtrong by its Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but we found nothing in it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe the trouble we had in going up to it. They ſhewed us from this height, about five hundred Paces from the City, a Church which had been conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Concord,</hi> and is now call'd <hi>The Chapel of the Crucifix.</hi> There are at <hi>Spoletto</hi> ſome other old Fragments, a Triumphal-Arch half ruined, ſome Remainders of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheatre, and divers looſe Marble Stones, but without any Inſcriptions, except the Arch, on which we may yet diſtinguiſh ſome Characters. The Aqueduct which
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:45740:155"/>
joyns the Mountain of St. <hi>Francis</hi> to that of <hi>Spoletto,</hi> is the more conſiderable, in that it is entire, and hath always been in uſe ſince it was firſt made: But this is a <hi>Gothick</hi> Work; it is three hundred and fifty Paces in length, and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty Foot high, meaſuring from the top of it to the bottom of the Valley.</p>
                     <p>Three Miles on this ſide <hi>Spoletto,</hi> we paſſed the <hi>Somma,</hi> which is the higheſt Mountain on this Road. And after we had been for five or ſix Miles amongſt the dry and deſart Rocks; thoſe Rocks were on a ſudden changed into Embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments. During the ſpace of four Miles, we found Nature had employed all its endeavours to cover theſe Mountains en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely with Laurels, wild Olive-Trees, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marinds, Junipers, Ever-green Oaks, and a wonderful variety of other Trees or Shrubs, which preſerve their Verdure all the Winter. If you paſs that way in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> you find it ſtill almoſt the ſame. 'Tis true, that as the Plain of <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligno</hi> looks chearful and pleaſant, this ſeems to have a ſad and melancholy Beauty. At our approach to <hi>Terni,</hi> thoſe Mountains which had always confined us in a ſtreight Paſſage, on the Brink of the Torrent, which runs at the bottom of the Valley, left us by degrees, and we found our ſelves in a great Foreſt of Olive-Trees. Theſe Trees were loaden with Fruits, it being the Cuſtom to let them ripen till
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:45740:155"/>
they fall off themſelves, or with the leaſt ſhaking. The green Olives which they preſerve in Pickle, are gathered before they are ripe, and they take away their bitterneſs by Art. Thoſe which are ripe have no leſs bitterneſs than the green ones. And it is very ſtrange that the bittereſt of Fruits ſhould produce the ſweeteſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. As we left this Wood of Olives, we travelled about a Mile in a Plain, whoſe agreeable Air, and Fruitfulneſs, was little inferiour to that of <hi>Foligno;</hi> and then came to <hi>Terni,</hi> which is on the River <hi>Nera,</hi> in the midſt of this excellent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Terni</hi> is leſs than <hi>Spoletto,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">TERNI.</note> but appeared to us ſomewhat better peopled. Its whole Trade conſiſts in Oil. They told us, that during ſix Months of the Year,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pliny</hi> praiſes the Cabbages and Turneps of <hi>Interamnia.</hi> (It has been called <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amnia, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amnia,</hi> and <hi>Interamni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi>)</note> they make there an hundred Charges of Oil every Day.

This City is very<note n="*" place="margin">Interamnia anno ante Chriſtum 671 condita, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vente Numâ Pompilio.</note> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. It appears by an Inſcription which we obſerved in the Porch of the Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, near the Cathedral, that its Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not of much later date than that of <hi>Rome.</hi> This Inſcription was made for <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi> and the date is, <hi>Poſt Interramnam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditam</hi> DC C IIII. <hi>Terni</hi> was called <hi>Interam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> or <hi>Interamnium,</hi> by reaſon of its ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>inter amnes,</hi> between the two Arms of the River which Waters it.

                     <p>We went- to ſee the famous Water-fall of Mount <hi>del Marmore,</hi> which is three Miles from <hi>Terni.</hi> The Way is rough and pleaſant both together. You muſt aſcend very difficult Rocks, and ſometimes light from your Horſe for fear of Precipices: But, in recompence, we had the pleaſure in theſe Mountains to meet with ſome Nooks to the <hi>Southward,</hi> which never felt the Winter. We found amongſt the Buſhes, Jaſmins, Laurels, Myrtles, Roſemary, and Nature ſmiling in <hi>February,</hi> (though it had been a very hard Winter) as much as you find it in <hi>April</hi> in your Iſland. At the third part of the Way, aſcending the Hill <hi>Papinio,</hi> I obſerv'd below on the River ſide, a great ſpace of Ground, planted with O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range-Trees. I counted at leaſt ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; and this was the firſt time we ſaw them in them in the plain Field without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Shelter.

Mountain, conſidering the depth which attends it; there then this River which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready marched with a ſwift Current, all in an inſtant throws it ſelf down from a craggy Rock, three hundred Paces high, and falls into the hollow of another Rock, againſt which its Waters break themſelves with ſuch Violence, that it riſes like a Cloud of Duſt, double the height of the Fall, which makes a perpetual Rain in all the adjacent parts. This pulverized Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter forms in the Sun an infinite number of Rain-bows, which are always diminiſhing and encreaſing; which croſs themſelves, and flutter about, according to the various rebounding and ſpurting up of the Surges, and as this Watry Smoke is thicker or thinner. I can aſſure you, the ſight of this Object fills the Spectator with an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment that I cannot expreſs.

I obſerved, as we paſſed, two pretty handſome Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Braſs. The Emperour <hi>Nerva</hi> was a Native of <hi>Narni.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We turned aſide, a little before we went into the City, to ſee the Ruines of a Bridge, which, as they ſay, was built un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Empire of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and which they look upon as a thing worthy of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. The great pieces of Marble with which it is built, are joined dry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Cement, and without Hold-faſts of Iron. Its height is extraordinary; it joyns the Mountain of <hi>Spoletto</hi> to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Mountain, and ends in the Way that leads to <hi>Peruſa.</hi> Of four or five Arches, there remains but one entire; the top of the Mold of the greateſt is broken. Many
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:45740:157"/>
Perſons, who I believe are well informed, have told me, that this Arch is one hundred and ſeventy foot in breadth; and one may by the Eye gueſs it near ſo much; which far exceeds the famous Bridge of the <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Departing from <hi>Narni,</hi> we found our ſelves again between the Mountains, which continue for eight Miles, to the Town of <hi>Otricoli:</hi> Near that on a Plain,<note place="margin">OTRICOLI.</note> are the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of the ancient <hi>Ocriculum.</hi> We went a little aſide to take a nearer view of theſe diſmal Remains, but we could find nothing which might afford us any Inſtruction. A while after we paſſed the <hi>Tyber,</hi> over a fair Stone Bridge, which was begun under <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. and finiſhed under <hi>Urban</hi> VIII. as appears by an Inſcription engraven on it.</p>
                     <p>It was late before we arrived at <hi>Citta-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellana;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">CITTA-CAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TELLANA.</note> and our intention being to part thence early the next Morning, we willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave credit to the Report of thoſe, who told us we ſhould find nothing remarkable in it.</p>
                     <p>Near to <hi>Regnano,</hi> we found the old <hi>Via Flaminia,</hi> with its Pavement of nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years continuance, which remains entire in this place to Admiration; we not having perceived any Footſteps of it ſince we left <hi>Rimini,</hi> to which this Way extended it ſelf. I ſhall give you a more particular Account of it on ſome other Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>

                        <pb n="260" facs="tcp:45740:158"/>We dined at <hi>Caſtel Nuovo,</hi> which is but a Paltry Town, as well as <hi>Regnano.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the reſt of the Country hitherto, is untill'd, and without Inhabitants: The Soil is bad and the Land generally flat, but uneven. We ſaw every where an infinite Number of ancient Ruines.

                     <p>IT is ſo pleaſant to travel in good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that for this reaſon we readily engaged in a Journey to <hi>Naples,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſooner than we had deſign'd. There are many ſurprizing Rarities in this excellent Country, which may be obſerv'd by thoſe who have the Patience to wait till the Spring is a little advanc'd. Beſides,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:45740:158"/>
in this Seaſon the Fields begin to put on a more ſmiling Countenance; and all the Journey is extreamly pleaſant. 'Tis true, it hath been ſo hard a Winter, that we could not expect a forward Spring; and we now find, that tho' we had taken their Counſel, who adviſed us to put off our Journey till <hi>April,</hi> we could not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected any conſiderable Advantage by ſo long a delay, by reaſon of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Cold. And beſides, this would have ſpoiled all our Meaſures at <hi>Rome,</hi> where we intend to remain without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, ſince we deſign not to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny long ſtay there.</p>
                     <p>They commonly account it five Days Journey from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Naples:</hi> The Road is bad, and we met with but few things worthy of Obſervation in it: But we find what may make us amends at <hi>Naples,</hi> at the Mountain of <hi>Veſuvius,</hi> and amongſt the Rareties of <hi>Bayae, Puzzolo,</hi> and other neighbouring places.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore after we had rambled about <hi>Rome</hi> for two or three Days, and run o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the principal things which our Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity thirſted after, we left it in order to our Journey for <hi>Naples.</hi> Twelve Miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> we came to <hi>Marino,</hi> a great Town belonging to the Prince <hi>Colonna,</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known by the Name of the <hi>Villa Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> Here we left the level Country,<note place="margin">Marino, <hi>or</hi> Villa Marii.</note> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from <hi>Marino,</hi> aſcended a ſtony Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, where are nothing to be found but Wood and <hi>Buffalo's.</hi> I ſhall ſay nothing

                     <p>As we deſcended the Mountain four or five Miles on this ſide the Lake, we diſcovered the Sea, and ſaw on a little Hillock on the Right-hand, the City cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Citta de la Vigna,</hi> which is the ancient <hi>Lanuvium;</hi> a Municipal City, and the place where <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> was born; and not the <hi>Lavinium</hi> of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> as the vulgar Opinion is. <hi>Lavina Litora</hi> are ten or twelve Miles from thence, towards that part where <hi>Prattica</hi> is now ſeated.</p>

                     <p>'Tis the general Opinion here, and even the Servants at the Inn inform'd us at our Arrival, that the City of <hi>Velitri</hi> was honoured with the birth of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> Some one of our Company asked who that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was, and were anſwer'd, that he was the firſt Chriſtian Emperour.

                     <p>In the midſt of the great Place of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litri,</hi> there is a very fine Statue of Braſs of Pope <hi>Urban</hi> VIII. I obſerved that the Statues of the Popes always repreſent them ſitting. This is done, without doubt, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the Empire which they have over all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes in the World. They carried us to the Marquiſs <hi>Ginetti</hi>'s Houſe; the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of which is very agreeable, and the Apartments adorn'd with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Antiquities.</p>
                     <p>Coming down the Hill of <hi>Velitri,</hi> we obſerved a great number of Caves, and Cellars dug, under the Rocks, to preſerve the Wines cool.

This Tree extreamly reſembles an Ever-green Oak; and I believe we may very well call it a kind of Oak, ſince it bears Acorns.

Earthquakes, and other Accidents, Plains are raiſed up, and Hills fall down; Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys are filled up; the Earth gains upon the Sea, and the Sea on the Earth; the Sea makes the Earth Lakes, and the Earth turns the Sea to Iſlands; Rivers are dried up, and change their Courſe; Mountains ſwell, and become level; and the Figure of the Globe is in perpetual variation. I could produce Examples of all this. It is true, theſe Changes are not univerſal. The length of the Pavement, for Example, which continues for two Miles or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, to <hi>Terracina,</hi> is exactly level with the circumjacent Lands.</p>
                     <p>Of all the Antique Monuments I have ſeen hitherto, there is nothing in my mind deſerves ſo much to be admir'd, as theſe famous Roads. The Buildings which are preſerved, have been expoſed to few Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents; and all things being well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it is rather matter of Aſtoniſhment, that Edifices ſo exceedingly ſolid, were ſo ſoon ruined, than to ſee them ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But that an innumerable Number of Paſſengers, Horſes, and Chariots, ſhould inceſſantly tread on a Pavement for ſo many Ages, and yet ſo conſiderable Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it ſhould ſtill be found entire, is a thing which ſeems incredible.

To ſpeak generally, the greateſt, in their
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:45740:163"/>
largeſt Dimenſions are little more than two Feet, and the leaſt not leſs than one. Though the ſhape of theſe Stones be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, they are all ſo exactly join'd, and cloſely united, that it is impoſſible to thruſt a Sword's Point between them, in thoſe places which have ſtill kept their old ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation. I have meaſured the breadth of theſe two Ways, <hi>Via Appia,</hi> and <hi>Via Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minia,</hi> and I found them throughout twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Roman</hi> Palms broad, with very little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; which makes fourteen Foot, leſs by four Inches, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Meaſure: This is not too much for the meeting of two Chariots. Theſe Ways which they call <hi>Viae Conſulares,</hi> had on each ſide Borders of the ſame Stone with the Pavement; and theſe Borders ſtood up two Foot, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts: I have ſeen them in ſome places very well preſerved. Theſe were called the<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Cippi.</hi> 'Tis true, they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time called <hi>Marginatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> But <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> pretends that theſe <hi>Marginatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> were Pavements on the ſides, which were made bigger than the other.

                        <hi>Margines,</hi> or <hi>Marginationes Viarum;</hi> it is between theſe Borders the Ways are to be meaſured at a certainty. The Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot Wheels have in ſome places made deep Ruts, at the moſt three or four Inches; and the manner after which the Canal of this Rut is followed from one Pavement to another, is one of the Proofs of its ancient ſituation. The reſt of the Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is even and whole, without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance that the Horſe-ſhooes have worn it in the leaſt. They told me, that there is another very thick Lay of Stone, placed on a Bed of Sand, which ſerves for
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:45740:163"/>
the Foundation of this Pavement, and hinders it from ſinking. When we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached to <hi>Terracina,</hi> we ſaw on both ſides, the Ruines of many ancient Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which, according to Cuſtom, were erected near theſe great Roads, both for Ornament, and to give Travellers ſome <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Magnificence. After all if on the one ſide theſe Ways were beautiful and advantageous; on the other ſo hard and ſlippery a Pavement, was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its inconveniencies: and we took care to avoid it, at the ſame time we admired it.</p>

Some conjecture, that the principal end of the Undertaker, was to meaſure his Work, and that he marked the Diviſions only ſlightly, it being no advantage to him. Others believe that every Diſtance is the Work of ten Days; and that the inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the diſtances was cauſed by the more or leſs eaſe the Workmen found in cutting the Rock. And that which gave occaſion for this Thought is, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances above are greater than thoſe below, the Rock ſtill growing narrower towards the top. But I find one main Objection againſt this Sentiment; for probably they began to work at the top of the Rock; ſo that the firſt Tenth ſhould have been marked above, and the Number CXX. found below; all this ſeems to me not eaſie to be underſtood.</p>

                        <hi>Fondi</hi> is all paved with Stones of the <hi>Via Appia,</hi> but we do not find that they are joined ſo well as heretofore. Near the Caſtle, there is a great Garden, which, according to Tradition, belonged to <hi>Cicero.</hi> I believe there are no other Proofs of it.

1273, or according to the old Legend, 1274; by which you may judge of the Age of this Tree. There is a Story of a certain Tree of <hi>Cochin-China,</hi> which lived two thouſand Years; and we have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>China,</hi> which tells us of a Tree ſo old and ſo big, that twenty Men could ſcarcely embrace it: But Orange-Trees are not of ſo long continuance. It is an incredible thing, for every body aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures me here, that never any of theſe Trees attained to the Age of four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years. It was neceſſary the <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans</hi> ſhould have ſome miraculous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of the Angelical St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> as well as of their great Patriarch St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> of whom they have another Orange-Tree, at St. <hi>Sabina,</hi> on Mount <hi>Aventin:</hi> But what may not a Man believe on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, after what <hi>Surius</hi> relates of the old Olive-Trees of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Fig-Tree, which was to be ſeen within theſe two and thirty Years? That this Trunk hath laſted ſo long, after the Curſe it received, is a thing not eaſie to be underſtood, without taking notice of the nature of the Tree, which allows it not ſo long a Life.</p>
                     <p>They would perſuade us at <hi>Terracina,</hi> that we ſhould find the Leaves of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range-Tree of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> of another ſhape than thoſe of other Orange-Trees; as they talk of the Almond-Tree of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> which is yet to be ſeen on Mount <hi>Luco,</hi> and of which the Leaves grow, as they
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:45740:165"/>
ſay, with Croſſes well ſhaped. But we could not perceive this pretended difference; nor could we find that the Winter had been more favourable to the Oranges of this venerable Tree; for they were all frozen, as well as thoſe of the Garden of <hi>Cicero,</hi> who, I may tell you by the bye, paſſes at <hi>Fondi</hi> for a kind of Saint, as well as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> at <hi>Velitri:</hi> When this Tree ſhall die, if at leaſt it ever muſt, they propoſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to make a Shrine of it, to contain ſome Relicks of the Saint who planted it. This is no ill Thought. It is thus that they keep ſomewhere in a Village of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol,</hi> one of the biggeſt Nails of St. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher,</hi> in a Caſe which is made of the Palm-Tree which grew from his Pole, after he had planted it in the Earth, when he carried over the Child <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> from one ſide of the River to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Leaving <hi>Fondi,</hi> we were oftentimes forc'd to purſue our Way on the old Pavement, for ten Miles, to <hi>Mola.</hi> One is almoſt always amongſt the Mountains; and this unevenneſs of the Soil joined to the hardneſs and ſmoothneſs of the Stones, renders the Way very troubleſome. The Horſes ſhiver as they go, as if they were upon Ice; and muſt be every Foot new ſhod. At our approach to <hi>Itru,</hi> which is a little City on a Rock, ſix Miles from <hi>Fondi,</hi> I obſerved in divers places of theſe Mountains, large Trees, called in this Country <hi>Soucellés,</hi> which bear Cods of half a Foot long, or thereabouts, and

                     <p>Going up by the little Door of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Palace, over-againſt the Altar of the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> there is a Marble Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of an old Man, who ſets his Feet on a little Dog; under the Dog is a Death's Head; a Serpent, whoſe Tail is placed on the Dog, wraps it ſelf about the Legs of the old Man, reſts on his Head, and hath an Eagle on his. There are an hundred different Opinions concerning this Piece. That which is moſt generally received is, That the old Man repreſents <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> with his Serpent: That the Dog ſignifies the Vigilance and Attention required in Phyſicians; and that the Eagle repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the Empire of GOD over Men, perhaps the God of Phyſick particularly.: And the Death's Head is an Emblem of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:45740:168"/>
Humane Nature, ſadly ſubjected to that Deity. The Sculpture is four Palms in height.</p>
                     <p>When we landed at <hi>Cajeta,</hi> the Officers of the Garriſon made ſtrict inquiſition whether there were any <hi>Frenchmen</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; and after they had aſſured themſelves that we were all <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they told us, that ſince the quarrel of <hi>France</hi> with the Pope, they were always appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of thoſe Men-devouring <hi>French.</hi> This puts me in mind of what hapned two Years ſince, at our coming to <hi>Mons,</hi> another <hi>Spaniſh</hi> City. There was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that an Army of <hi>French</hi> was coming, under pretence of guarding the Poſt of <hi>Namur,</hi> to make an irruption into the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Territories: Upon this, the People of <hi>Mons</hi> opened their Sluces, drowned all the Meadows, and ſpoiled all the Ways: The <hi>French</hi> knew nothing of all this; the poor Travellers were the only ſufferers: We were fain to undergo a Thouſand Fatigues, to get out of their drowned Ways.</p>
                     <p>Departing from <hi>Mola,</hi> we coaſted the Sea for ſome Hours, always following the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> Way, for eight Miles together, to the Ruines of the City of <hi>Minturna.</hi>

irregular. The Curious, who have walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round the Walls, reckon that it is nine Miles in compaſs, and that it is eighteen if you include its ſeven Suburbs. Altho' it hath endured terrible Aſſaults,<note place="margin">One of their Poets plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly ſaid, That <hi>Naples</hi> ſeems to have fallen from Heaven.</note> it is ſtill one of the moſt noble, and perhaps fineſt Cities in the World. It is paved through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with great ſquare Stones, cut to a Pattern. The Streets are ſtrait, and moſt of them broad. The Houſes are high, with flat Roofs, and uniform Building. <hi>London, Paris, Rome, Venice,</hi> and a great number of other Cities, have, in truth, fine No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemens Houſes; but theſe Houſes are mixed with great a number of ordinary ones, whereas <hi>Naples</hi> is generally all very fair. The Sea makes a little Bay, which waſhes it to the <hi>South.</hi> To the <hi>North</hi> it hath rich Hills, whereby you riſe inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly into <hi>Campagna Felice. Eaſtward</hi> is a Plain which leads to <hi>Veſuvius;</hi> and in the <hi>Weſt</hi> is the high Town, where are the <hi>Chartreux,</hi> and the Caſtle of St. <hi>Eraſmus.</hi> The Proſpect which we have of this Aſcent is very charming: I will give you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it in the ſequel.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, that the Houſes of <hi>Naples</hi> are commonly great, and well built, there is a conſiderable number which deſerve the Name of Palaces. For Example: Thoſe of the Dukes of <hi>Matalone, Gravina, Airo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> and <hi>de la Tour;</hi> of the Princes of St. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatha, Mont-milet, Botera,</hi> and <hi>Cellamara.</hi> The Palace of the Vice-Roy is in a great <hi>Place;</hi> the Front is regular, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:45740:171"/>
with three Orders of Architecture. It is near four hundred Feet in length, of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Meaſure, and is the Work of the famous <hi>Montana.</hi> The three Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles which defend <hi>Naples;</hi> the Academy, which they call <hi>Studii Nuovi;</hi> the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for riding the Great Horſe; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents; the Hoſpitals; the Arſenal, and the Magazines for the Gallies, are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Edifices of very great Note. There are many Fountains, which contribute as well to the great Conveniency, as Embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the City: And three of theſe Fountains are of an incomparable gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and beauty. But that which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us moſt extraordinary at <hi>Naples</hi> was the Number and Magnificence of the Churches. It may be juſtly ſaid, that in this reſpect it ſurpaſſes Imagination. If one would take a view of the fine Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Architecture, the Churches muſt be viſited, you muſt behold the Frontiſpiece, the Portals, the Chapels, the Altars, and the Tombs. If you would look upon rare Pictures, Sculptures, and the rarety of Veſſels of Gold and Silver, you need but go to the Churches; the Arches, the Wainſcots, the Walls are all covered with pieces of precious Marble, moſt artificially laid together, or with Compartiments of <hi>Baſſo Relievo,</hi> or of Joyners-work gilded, and enriched with the Works of the moſt famous Painters. There is nothing to be ſeen but <hi>Jaſper, Porphyrie, Moſaick</hi> of all faſhions, and the Quinteſcence of Art.
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:45740:171"/>
I viſited five and twenty, or thirty of theſe ſtately Edifices, where one ſtill finds him ſelf ſurprized afreſh. If it were poſſible to unite eight or ten together, and make a regular Compoſition out of 'em all, I believe it would be the moſt magnificent Structure in the World.</p>
                     <p>I dare not venture on an exact Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of ſo many Particulars, yet cannot forbear to mention at leaſt ſome of theſe Churches, which we found moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſince perhaps it may be of uſe to you hereafter. The Church of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> is an admirable Piece: The <hi>Dome</hi> was paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Chevalier <hi>Lanfranc;</hi> and which way ſoever you turn in this ſtately Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, all parts are enriched with moſt coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ornaments, from the Pavement to the Roof. It is the ſame in St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s of the <hi>Annonciata,</hi> which we may juſtly ſay, is of moſt ſplendid beauty.<note place="margin">The Religious may purchaſe from right to left, all the neighbouring Houſes, til they come to be bounded by ſome Street; ſo that there being no Street without a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, they may purchaſe the whole City. <hi>G.

                        </note> There you may ſee alſo that famous Hoſpital, whoſe Revenue amounts to above two hundred thouſand Ducats of Gold. All is very rich and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing; St. <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Neri, Santa Maria la Nuovo,</hi> St. <hi>Severin</hi>'s, St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, St. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi>'s, the Church and Monaſtery of <hi>Mount Olivet;</hi> at the Church of the <hi>Holy Apoſtles,</hi> St. <hi>John Carbonare,</hi> the Cathedral, the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Hoſpital, and St. <hi>Mary's of Health.</hi> I omit above three hundred others to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void a tedious prolixity: Nor will I take notice of their Treaſures and Veſtries, which are repleniſhed with prodigious Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Two of the <hi>Theatines</hi> having led
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:45740:172"/>
us into their Church of the <hi>Holy Apoſtles,</hi> thoſe good Fathers declared to us by the manner of their Diſcourſe, the poor condition of their Order, who have, ſay they, more reaſon than any others to complain: For if the <hi>Mendicants,</hi> for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, have no proper Goods, yet, at leaſt, they have liberty to beg: Whereas, the poor and unhappy <hi>Theatines</hi> live only on God's Providence, poſſeſſing nothing, and not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ask any thing. Arguing after this manner, after they had made us obſerve the various Magnificencies of their Church, they brought us into the Veſtry; where we found fourteen great Cupboards, with double Doors, all filled with Veſſels of Gold and Silver, and other precious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments: A Treaſure of poor People, ſufficient to ſatisfie the moſt inordinate Ambition.</p>
                     <p>The great Convent of the <hi>Chartreux</hi> at St. <hi>Martin's,</hi> is extraordinary full of rare and magnificent things: The Monks who conducted us thither, affirmed to us, that under one Priorate, there were laid out amongſt them five hundred thouſand Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats in Silver Plate, Pictures, and Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures only. Their Church is none of the greateſt; but every part of it deſerves Admiration: Nothing can be added either to the value of the Matter, or excellence of the Workmanſhip; all is compleat, and exquiſitely beautiful. The Nativity of Chriſt, by <hi>Guido,</hi> is an excellent Piece: The four Pictures of the laſt Supper,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:45740:172"/>
which are to be ſeen in the ſame place, were done by <hi>Eſpagnolet, Ann. Carache, Paul Veroneſe,</hi> and <hi>Cavalier Maſſimno.</hi> — — has thought fit to repreſent <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſtanding, giving the Sacrament to his Apoſtles, and putting the Bread into their Mouths, they being on their Knees. There are a great many other Pieces highly valued, too many to be here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</p>
                     <p>The Cloyſter is one hundred Paces ſquare: All the Pavement is of Marble, inlaid, repreſenting Boughs, and other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the like nature; and the four Galleries are ſupported by ſixty Pillars each, of one entire piece, of fine White Marble of <hi>Carrara.</hi> The Monks are pleaſantly lodged; every one hath his Chamber, his Cloſet, his Library, and his little Garden. The Prior's Apartment might well befit a Prince: There, amongſt other things, you may ſee the famous Crucifix of <hi>Michael Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> drawn, as is ſaid, from Nature to the Life, by a certain Peaſant, whom that Painter crucified for that purpoſe: This ſmells like a Fable; but here it goes current for a great Truth. This Picture is of Wood, and is not above half a Foot high. I obſerved that the Crucifix holds his Head exactly ſtreight, which agrees not very well with the Poſture of a Man expiring on a Croſs. They have alſo a Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> by <hi>Titian,</hi> and ſome Deſigns of <hi>Ruben's</hi> and <hi>Albert Durer,</hi> which they prize very highly.</p>

                     <p>THE City of <hi>Naples</hi> hath been ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ranſacked, and hath gone through the Hands of ſo many Maſters, that the greateſt part of its Antiquities have been buried in their own Ruins. The Front of St. <hi>Paul Major</hi> is the Frontiſpiece of the old Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> was afterwards dedicated to <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> by one <hi>Tiberius Julius Tarſus,</hi> a Freed-Man of <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> His Name is diſtinctly to be read on one of the Frieſes of this Frontiſpiece, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. The Portico is ſupported by eight channelled Pillars, of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Order; and on the Pediment are ſome <hi>Baſſo Relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo's,</hi> which repreſent the Deities.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="307" facs="tcp:45740:181"/>They ſay that the Columns of St. <hi>Reſtituta</hi> were taken from a Temple of <hi>Neptune.</hi> There alſo remain ſome Ruins of an Amphitheatre. We often took notice, as we paſſed, of an ancient Statue of the <hi>Nile,</hi> ſupported by a Crocodile. The Houſe of D. <hi>Diomodes Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raffa</hi> is exceedingly full of Sculptures and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Inſcriptions. You may ſee in the Court, the Head, and all the Creſt of a Horſe of Braſs, which had no Bridle, and which was ſometimes in one of the Places of <hi>Naples,</hi> as an Emblem of the Liberty of that City, when it was governed as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. But King <hi>Conrad</hi> cauſed a Bit to be put on this Horſe, as now appears, and wrote, as they ſay, theſe two Verſes, on the Pedeſtal which ſupported it.</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>There are alſo a great many old Ruins found on the Hill; where, as the Antiquaries ſay, was <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, towards St. <hi>Coſmus</hi> and St. <hi>Damian.</hi> And beſides that, ſeveral curious Perſons, as amongſt others, <hi>M. Richetti</hi> hath pick'd up divers Antiquities, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made Collections of Medals; from ſome whereof, great Light hath been drawn for the Hiſtory of <hi>Naples.</hi> I refer the ſpeaking of the <hi>Catacombs</hi> to another time.</p>
                     <p>You know with what exactneſs and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. extirpated the <hi>Banditti</hi> out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the Eccleſiaſtical State. But you alſo know that the other Princes of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi>
                        <pb n="308" facs="tcp:45740:182"/>
had not the ſame good Fortune, though all with common conſent undertook the Work. Theſe Bands of Thieves were more numerous than ever in the Kingdom of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi> and ſome Years ago, to travel ſecurely, they were forced to go in Caravans. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent there is nothing to be fear'd, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs <hi>del Carpio,</hi> laſt Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> hath at laſt freed that Country from the Robberies and Murders of that wicked Gang: Many of them have been put to the Sword, and others executed. There is a great number of them yet in Priſon; we ſaw five hundred of them in the Arſenal, who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred themſelves ſome Months ſince, on condition their Lives ſhould be ſaved, and they not ſent to the Galleys.</p>
                     <p>Futhermore, if they have exterminated all the <hi>Banditti</hi> by Profeſſion, there are ſtill remaining a great number of others who are little better. To ſpeak in general, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Naples</hi> are a very wicked People; the Priſons ſwarm with Malefactors; and they affirmed to us, that there are at preſent, in two Priſons only, about four thouſand who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve death. They did not hit amiſs, who ſaid, That <hi>Naples</hi> is a Paradiſe inhabited with Devils.</p>
                     <p>The City is extreamly fine, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told you; but there are many things which are not ſuitable to its Beauty, and which cloud the pleaſant Countenance it would otherwiſe have. Firſt, you can ſee no Women in it; it hath this fault in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, with all the other Cities of <hi>Italy.</hi>
                        <pb n="309" facs="tcp:45740:182"/>
You muſt not think I am become too much a Gallant, when I ſay, this is to hide ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculouſly the faireſt half of the World. Secondly, the Habits and Equipages of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> are of black and dark Colours, which are apt to inſpire Melancholy. You are forbidden to wear Gold or Silver, or Silk upon Silk. The greateſt Lord can have but two<note n="*" place="margin">Staffieri.</note> Footmen: And the greateſt part of the Coaches being drawn ſlowly by Mules, are both uneaſie and unpleaſant. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Dreſs is generally uſed. The Vice-Roy is ſeldom ſeen; and his Court looks dull and melancholy like the reſt. The Trade of <hi>Naples</hi> is much decayed: They make there a great deal of Soap, Snuff of Tabacco, Stockings, Waſtcoats, and other worſted Commodities.</p>
                     <p>We yeſterday made a Voyage to <hi>Veſuvius;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mount <hi>Veſuvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> See Letter <hi>XXXIII.</hi>
                        </note> the Journey was ſomewhat troubleſome, and the ſight of it dreadful. I will endeavour to give a more diſtinct account of it than you can receive from the Deſcriptions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made.</p>
                     <p>They reckon it eight Miles from <hi>Naples</hi> to the top of <hi>Veſuvius.</hi> During the firſt four Miles, we paſt through many good Villages, following the Sea-Coaſt: Theſe places are well till'd, and ſeem to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no damages from the Eruptions of the Mountain, notwithſtanding they have happen'd ſo frequently. There are only from place to place great Stones, which have been rolled thither.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="310" facs="tcp:45740:183"/>Going out of this laſt Village, called <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina,</hi> we turn'd to the Left, and began to aſcend; and you may ſtill travel on Horſe-back two large Miles, or two Miles and an half further, amongſt looſe Stones, and heaps of baked Earth, which the Vomitings of the Mountain have ſpread all about. The more you advance, the more you find the Soil cracked, dry, burned, and covered with ſeveral ſorts of calcined Stones, which are ſo many Monuments of thoſe furious Eruptions. You may alſo obſerve in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places, the Chanels of the Torrents of Sulphur and Bitumen, which have run down from the Mountain. In fine, the Aſcent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo rough and difficult, that you muſt be forced to go on Foot; you may believe there are neither Taverns, nor other Houſes, nor Boys to hold the Horſes.</p>
                     <p>I aſſure you there is a great deal of Pains and Trouble, which muſt be endured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can mount to this prodigious Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace. You are for the moſt part plunged amongſt the Aſhes, if one may properly give that the name of Aſhes, which rather reſembles Brick-duſt. Sometimes you fall back inſtead of advancing, becauſe the Aſhes give way under your Feet; and at laſt, after divers little reſtings, you come to the brim of the ancient Gulf; I ſay the ancient Gulf, becauſe you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by and by that things have ſome time ſince ſuffered great Alterations.</p>
                     <p>This firſt height on which we now are, makes a Circle round the Gulf: The top
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:45740:183"/>
of the Mountain having been worn, you may eaſily conceive what kind of Horns and rugged Elevations have been made in the circuit of its height. As near as we could gueſs, this vaſt melting Pot hath near a Mile Diameter; you may go down into it ſeveral ways, about an hundred Paces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſteep Circle of the brim of the Mountain, which is all the depth of this old Mouth.</p>
                     <p>By an extraordinary Eruption, this vaſt Abyſs was almoſt quite fill'd, in one of its laſt breakings out, with a mixture of Sulphur, of Bitumen, of Minerals, of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, of Nitre, of Salt-petre, and of Earth melted, or vitrified; all theſe matters gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving over boiling, have form'd a kind of thick Cruſt, or harden'd Scum, which made a level in the Gulf, an Hundred Paces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low its Brims. A furious ſhaking of the Mountain did afterward break this Cruſt, or thickneſs of harden'd Matter, and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the pieces one upon another, as when after you have broken the Ice of a Pond, a ſudden Froſt preſently cements all the pieces together. This rugged Superficies is every where equally uneven; and there are here and there burning Funnels; from whence the Fumes continually exhale: In ſome places you feel the Heat through your Shooes, only walking over it.</p>
                     <p>This is not all: Juſt in the middle of this Extent of the Mountain, which, you muſt know, is almoſt round; a furious E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption hath forced its Paſſage, and form'd
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:45740:184"/>
a new Mountain. This Mountain is alſo round, and is about a quarter of a Mile in height. I could not count the Paces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was impoſſible to make them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, by reaſon the Aſhes hinder it; which, as I have already told you, make one ſometimes ſlide back.</p>
                     <p>After we had traverſed that rough ſpace, which is like a low Trench, about Three hundred Paces broad between the Bounds of the greater and leſſer Mountains, as I have already deſcribed them. You mount the laſt with as much pains as you did the firſt. It is all full of ſmoaking Chinks. In many places you ſee Sulphur almoſt pure, with a kind of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> which is almoſt of a Citron Colour. In others, there is a reddiſh and porous Matter, like the Scum of Iron, which comes from Smiths Forges: There are pieces of all Colours, Faſhions, and Weights: All this having been baked and re-baked by ſo vehement a Fire, and this Compoſition of ſo many different Matters, having been melted and incorporated together, you may eaſily i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine what it is.</p>
                     <p>The top of the little Mountain hath its opening as well as the great one, which at preſent is the Throat of this vaſt Abyſs; we gueſſed it to be about an hundred Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in breadth. There iſſues out a flood of Smoak, which almoſt fills its Capacity; but there come ſometimes Guſts of Wind from above, which drive away this Smoak, ſometimes one way, and ſometimes another,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:45740:184"/>
which permitted us to view clearly the height of the Mouth, though at ſeveral times.</p>
                     <p>The Brink is perpendicular within, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in one place, where it is ſloping enough to deſcend into it. Our Guide going firſt down, three or fourſcore Paces before, we follow'd him; which (I muſt tell you by the bye) was unneceſſarily done, and which I would not adviſe any body to do. We were then on the Brink of this dreadful Precipice, and we rolled down many Stones, or hard Maſſes, which we looſened about us: Sometimes they ſtopped at the firſt or ſecond falling; at other times they made a long continuation of boundings with a great noiſe. It had been to no purpoſe to have computed the time theſe Stones took up in their leaps or deſcents, becauſe there is no bottom can be gueſſed at where they muſt ſtop at laſt; the noiſe ceaſing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, only in reſpect of thoſe who heard it, the diſtance alone rendring it inſenſible.</p>
                     <p>We could not perceive that what we tumbled into this Gulf did any way en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe its Smoak. It is true, greater Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were neceſſary for ſuch an Experiment; and yet it would have been very uncertain whether they would have produc'd any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; there being nothing to oblige us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is a Lake of of boiling mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which perpendicularly anſwers to the Mouth of the Mountain.</p>

up great Rocks: But to ſpeak freely, I think it a great folly to carry their Curioſity ſo far, in ſo dangerous a place; and I think it wiſely done not to ſtay there too long. The ſudden diſgorging of the Flames, is not what is to be moſt feared: But the quaking of the Mountain always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes the great Claps, and always comes very ſuddenly.

                     <p>In effect, this delicious Hill hath a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Situation: It is well cultivated, ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Houſes of Pleaſure, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of excellent Vines.</p>
                     <p>It is daily found, that Travellers are obliged to march up more difficult A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents than this; which naturally was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an eaſie ſloping Aſcent, and might have been made almoſt inſenſible, by fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up the Ways with Earth, ſupported by Walls: But out of an extravagant Humour, they pierced the Mountain, and through this Hole, made indeed a ſhorter Way, and of a more extraordinary Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, but an hundred times more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome than the Aſcent of the Hill: This Cave is commonly called,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>The Grotta of Puzzoli:</hi> It is cut in ſome places through the Rock, and in other places through the Sand.

This Light is very ſmall; and the Miſts of fine Duſt, which are raiſed by every Step we make, almoſt blind the Paſſengers: You muſt wrap up your Head, or cover your Face very well with a Handcherchief, if you will avoid breathing Earth inſtead of Air.

                     <p>This is an ancient Work: <hi>Seneca</hi> makes mention of it, and complained, as well as we, of its Duſt and Darkneſs.<note n="*" place="margin">P. Razzani; P. Jovius; L. Alberti; F. Lombardo; <hi>and many other Authors.</hi>

                        </note> They tell us a long and fabulous Story, which occaſioned the Denomination of theſe Baths, which, in my Opinion, is not worth the relating: You muſt know, after the third or fourth ſtep which you make to deſcend into them, you are ſeized with a heat, which ſmells of Brimſtome, and which puts you into a ſudden ſweat. Gouty Perſons, and thoſe that are troubled with ſome other Diſtempers, which are brought thither from all parts, receive, as they ſay, great benefit from them.</p>

                     <p>In the Night, between the 19th and 20th of <hi>September,</hi> in the Year 1538. the Earth was brought to Bed of a Mountain, which hath ever ſince been called the <hi>New Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:</hi> Thoſe who have meaſured it affirm,<note place="margin">Monte Nuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo, <hi>or</hi> di Cencre.</note> That it is Four hundred Toiſes high per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly, and three Miles and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in Circuit.

It was after this laſt manner this <hi>new Mountain</hi> was formed, as well as the other new one which I have repreſented to you in the midſt of the ancient Gulf of <hi>Veſuvius.</hi> The <hi>new Mountain</hi> hath a Gulf of fifty Paces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter in the middle of its top; which ſufficiently proves it was produc'd by Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But it hath never caſt out either Fire or Smoak ſince thoſe, which were the Cauſes of ſo prodigious and dolorous a Birth. The Earth quaked; the Sea recoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the <hi>Lucrin</hi> Lake was almoſt filled up; Churches and Houſes were ſet on fire, and ſwallow'd up; great numbers of Men and Beaſts periſhed; and there was a general and dreadful Conſternation through all the neighbouring Country.</p>

                     <p>The difference between what we now ſee of this place, and the Deſcription which the Ancients make of it to us, cauſes ſome to tax them commonly for Cheats, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any deliberation; particularly <hi>Pliny,</hi> whoſe Credit being crack'd on a great many other occaſions, is on this, looked upon as a great Lyar. Without undertaking here to make an abſolute Apology for him, I muſt defend him in this particular, and boldly affirm, That he is no Lyar in what he ſaith of the Lake of <hi>Averno.</hi> He quotes <hi>Varro,</hi> as relating a thing which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly was, but ſaith of himſelf nothing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:45740:193"/>
                        <hi>Pliny,</hi> a moſt curious Man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt had many times viſited this place. I think he was at <hi>Cumae,</hi> not far from thence, when <hi>Veſuvius</hi> burnt ſo terribly under the Empire of <hi>Titus;</hi> and that going towards that raging Mountain, he was ſo unfortunate as to loſe his Life. It is then probable enough that <hi>Pliny</hi> would have ſpoken poſitively, and as an Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Birds of <hi>Averno,</hi> if in his time the Air of the Lake had been ſo fatal to them: But he ſaith nothing like it. In his Diſcourſes of the Lakes which have extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Qualities, he cites <hi>Cleſias</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Hiſtorian, who ſpeaks of a Lake of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> on which nothing ſwims; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards produces the Teſtiomony of <hi>Varro</hi> touching the <hi>Averno. Strabo</hi> relates, that the Stench of this Lake was partly cauſed by the Trees that hung over its Sides, which covered and compaſſed it round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; and he adds, that theſe Woods being cut down by <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s Order, the Air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came pure, and left off producing its uſual effects.</p>
                     <p>If this matter be true, as it cannot juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be doubted, ſince this Author was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and ſpoke without queſtion, as a knowing Witneſs, we are not to admire at the poſitive teſtimony of <hi>Varro,</hi> or the Quotation of him by <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> ſince the one lived both before, and in the ſame time with <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and others came not till ſome time afterwards. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being too ready to believe theſe Writers,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:45740:194"/>
we may eaſily conceive, that things may have received Alterations ſince their times. <hi>Boccace,</hi> who lived three hundred years ſince, relates in his Treatiſe of Lakes, That ſome ſubterraneous ſtream of Sulphur, mixing with the <hi>Averno,</hi> the Waters of that Lake became ſtinking, and killed a great many of the Fiſh; which, he ſaith, he ſaw with his own Eyes. This makes it plainly appear, that this Lake hath not been always in the the ſame Condition: And the thing may be eaſily explain'd, if we will but a little reflect on the bituminous and ſulphureous Matters, of which the adjacent Country is full. Some Earthquake may have obſtructed the Canals of Communication, by which they ſpread themſelves into the Lake <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verno,</hi> which formerly poiſon'd its Waters, and cauſed it to exhale a ſubtil Matter, and the more dangerous becauſe the Source was ſhut up under the ſhelter of thoſe great Trees which inviron'd it. To imagine that the Birds which fly in the middle Region of the Air over the Lake, ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with its Exhalations, would be to frame a Chimera to ones ſelf, and make the Hiſtorians ſay what they never intended. There is a great deal of Appearance, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 'tis plain and certain, that if the Grotto of the <hi>Dog</hi> were but four or five times bigger than it is, a Swallow which ſhould fly there, ſweeping the Earth, could never riſe again: And why muſt it be reckoned impoſſible, that ſome ſuch thing might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly happen on the Lake of <hi>Averno?</hi> One
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:45740:194"/>
of thoſe places is greater than the other; but that alters not the Matter of Fact. If you would have another ſomewhat like this, and not ſo eaſie to be believed, I will quote your <hi>Natural Hiſtory of England,</hi> where it is related, that the Wild Geeſe fall dead, when they fly directly over a certain place of the Plain of <hi>Withay</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Furthermore, I will here repeat what I have often ſaid, that let things appear to be never ſo improbable, provided they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply no Contradiction, they ought not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily to be condemned for falſe, without due examination. It muſt be acknowledged, that the Ignorance of Men conceals more things than their Knowledge could ever diſcover. We may pleaſe our ſelves with acting the Philoſophers, and laugh at occult Qualities, but the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, to ſpeak ſincerely, are almoſt all incomprehenſible. We pretend to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and to be able to explain the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſeſt Appearances that happen before our own Eyes, and would be aſhamed to own our Ignorance: But if we are told of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing which ſurpaſſes our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or we have not before heard of, we immediately conclude it to be either a Miracle or a Lye.</p>
                     <p>Though the Word <hi>Avernus</hi> comes from <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, as <hi>Virgil</hi> ſaid; there are ſo many Lakes which bear this Name, that we may look upon it as a general Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for thoſe Sulphurous Gulphs, which
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:45740:195"/>
the Ancients call the Gates or Throats of Hell; <hi>Oſtia Ditis; Orci Janua; Inferni Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nua Regis,</hi> as <hi>Virgil</hi> calls them. I fanſie one might ſay the ſame thing of another Lake not far from this, which is one of the <hi>Acherons.</hi> And it is apparent that this made <hi>Lucretius</hi> call theſe kinds of Pools <hi>Averna Loca. Silius</hi> confounds our <hi>Averno</hi> with <hi>Styx</hi> and <hi>Cocytus,</hi> and the other Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Hell; which may contribute to our believing, that theſe Names became common to many Lakes or Rivers of the like Nature.</p>
                     <p>The Ruines which appear in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on the ſide of the Hills about the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verno,</hi> ſhew that this place was extremely well cultivated, after they had cut down the Wood of tall Trees which ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
                     <p>It is uncertain whether the Ruines which are next to the Lake, are of a Temple of <hi>Mercury,</hi> or of <hi>Neptune;</hi> but Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries agree, that it was not of a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> as the Vulgar ſuppoſe.</p>
                     <p>I muſt not forget to tell you, that when one comes near the <hi>Averno,</hi> he is ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly aſſaulted by a noiſome Smell; but am not ſure that it proceeds from the Lake; for its Waters are freſh, and clear enough, though they encline ſomething to a dark Blue. I taſted them in ſevera places, and found they had a little ſharp tang of the Mineral; notwithſtanding which, the Lake abounds with Fiſh.</p>

                        <pb n="335" facs="tcp:45740:195"/>That which they commonly call the Grotto of the <hi>Sibyl</hi> is hard by.<note place="margin">The Grotto of the <hi>Sibyl.</hi>
                        </note> The chief entrance, as they ſay, was near to <hi>Cumae,</hi> about four Miles from <hi>Averno,</hi> but it is all filled up on that ſide: We went into the great Grotto by a narrow Paſſage, peſter'd with Briars and Thorns, every one with a lighted Torch in his Hand. The Cavern is dug under the Hillocks, without Ornaments, or any thing remarkable, except the place I will preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcribe to you. It is about ten Foot broad, and twelve high. After you have gone about two hundred and fifty Paces, without turning, the Grotto hath a ſquare place on the Right, and ſeventy or eighty Paces farther you find a little Cell of fifteen Foot in length, and eight or nine in breadth: The Roof was formerly painted, and the Walls covered with Moſaick; of which there are ſtill ſome Remainders: The Earth being fallen ſome paces beyond the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the Paſſage is dammed up, and you can go no further.</p>
                     <p>I remember that after I had read the learned Treatiſe of Mr. <hi>Blondel,</hi> concerning the pretended <hi>Sibyls,</hi> and their ſuppoſed <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylline</hi> Writings, I eaſily freed my ſelf from the power of vulgar Prejudices, and was fully perſuaded that all was chimerical and ſuppoſititious: Whatſoever a conſiderable number of learned Men had formerly ſaid, or ſome of thoſe honeſt Doctors of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whom we uſually call <hi>Fathers.</hi> I was afterwards confirmed in this Opinion, by ſtudying this Matter with a competent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:45740:196"/>
of Application; and therefore you may eaſily think,<note place="margin">Some pretend that the Cave of the <hi>Sibyl</hi> was at <hi>Cumae,</hi> and they cite the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> makes of it. What he ſaid has ſome relation to what <hi>Virgil</hi> ſpeaks. But at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, the opinion of <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> is no proof; he tells you what he heard ſaid, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing.</note> that I give little credit to what they talk here of this <hi>Sibyl</hi>'s Grotto. Many ancient Authors have ſpoken of a <hi>Sibylla Cumaea,</hi> and of a Den to which ſhe retired; and People have imagin'd that this may agree with it, and have conſecrated it to her without any other reaſon than bare imagination, and without alledging any tolerable Arguments. The Paſſage of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil, Exciſum Euboicae,</hi> &amp;c. ſignifies nothing at all: For beſides, that in <hi>Virgil</hi>'s time, the Fable of the <hi>Sibyl</hi> was accounted an old Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; of which that Author ſpoke only by Tradition: I cannot ſee that what he ſaid hath any relation to this Cavern.</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>There is no appearance that this Cave ever had <hi>centum aditus,</hi> or <hi>centum oſtia;</hi> but why, I pray, muſt there be a Cave above a League in length, for the lodging a <hi>Sibyl?</hi> And what Workmen had ſhe to employ in ſo prodigious a Task? It is alſo ridiculous to think that ſhe had her Chamber wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcotted with Moſaick; a deep and dark Den, hanged with Bats and Cobwebs, is what more properly belonged to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended mad Woman, than Chambers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with Painting and Moſaick,</p>
                     <p>If you will know what is my Opinion of this Den, I muſt anſwer you, That per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it was a Paſſage like the Grotto of <hi>Pauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypus,</hi>
                        <pb n="337" facs="tcp:45740:196"/>
and perhaps alſo the Painted<note n="*" place="margin">One may alſo ſuppoſe that there were Baths there for ſome great Lord.</note> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was for ſome Deity, as the Chapel of the ſame Grotto of <hi>Pauſilypus</hi> is for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Image of <hi>our Lady. Strabo</hi> relates upon the Teſtimony of <hi>Ephorus,</hi> an ancient Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian and Geographer of <hi>Cumae,</hi> That the <hi>Cimmerians</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> (I call them ſo, that I may not confound them with thoſe of the <hi>Boſphorus</hi>) did inhabit between <hi>Bayae</hi> and the Lake of <hi>Averno;</hi> that they had no other Dwellings than ſubterraneous Dens, where they hid themſelves all Day, and at Night iſſued out to perpetrate their Robberies and Murders. We will, if you pleaſe, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the digging of this Cave to them; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Moſaick agrees little better with them than with the <hi>Sibyl.</hi> To conclude, though I ſhould tell you, that I neither know the uſe of this Grotto, nor when it was made, nor who were the Workmen, it would by no means follow that it was the <hi>Sibyl</hi>'s Grotto. Without going further than<note n="*" place="margin">near to <hi>Mire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> in <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gort,</hi> there is a great and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Cave, called the <hi>Clouſeau;</hi> of which the Country People tell divers Stories: They ſay, that there are great Halls, Pictures, and Altars, and are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that the Pagans there ſacrificed to <hi>Venus,</hi> and the infernal Gods. <hi>Moreri.</hi>

                     <head>LETTER XXIII.</head>
                     <p>I Cannot expreſs the Pleaſure with which I read your long Letter, that part of it eſpecially which aſſures me that my Letters have given you ſome Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                     <p>I do not intend to trouble you with Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the preſent Occurrences in your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, of which you have given me an Account: For beſides, that ſuch a Deſign would engage me into long and uſeleſs Digreſſions, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that an Anſwer to thoſe new Queſtions
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45740:218"/>
which you propoſe concerning <hi>Venice,</hi> will be more acceptable to you. I will endeavour then to anſwer them ſuccinctly, and in the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in which you have rank'd them; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards proceed to entertain you with my Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations concerning <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">I. Your <hi>Venetian Gentleman</hi> may affirm as poſitively as he pleaſes, That <hi>Venice</hi> contains <hi>Two hundred and fifty thouſand</hi> Souls; but you muſt not imagine, that becauſe he is a Citizen of <hi>Venice,</hi> he muſt be a competent Judge of the number of its Inhabitants; that is a thing which neither his Eyes nor mine can ever be able to determine, nor can it be known without a very diligent and nice Enquiry: And therefore I am ſtill of the opinion, that this Controverſie ought to be decided by the Authority of thoſe who have grounded their Calculations on a careful and particular Examination. I told you, that the Computation which I follow, comprehends the Inhabitants of <hi>la Giudeca,</hi> for I look upon that Iſland as a part of the City of <hi>Venice;</hi> but I do not include the Iſle of <hi>Murana.</hi> In the mean time you muſt give me leave to tell you, that you carry the point too far, when you pretend, that 'tis impoſſible to make a judgment of the number of the Inhabitants of a great City; for, if you conſider what has been done by Sir <hi>William Petty,</hi> you will be convinc'd, that there are rational methods to make ſuch a computation, without any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Error.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:45740:218"/>II. The two great Columns of <hi>Granite,</hi> which are near the Sea, at the end of the place call'd the <hi>Broglio,</hi> were brought from<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <p>They might have been brought from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Venice.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It was one <hi>Nic. Baratier</hi> who undertook to fix them in the place where they ſtill remain. He ask'd no other Recompence, but that he might have leave to ſet up a Priviledg'd Gaming-houſe between the two Columns; which was granted him.</p>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Egypt,</hi> or, as ſome ſay, from <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The Lyon of St. <hi>Mark</hi> holding an open Book, with the Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ption of <hi>Pax tibi, Marce,</hi> &amp;c. is upon one of theſe Columns; and thoſe are the Arms of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi> The Statue of S. <hi>Theodore</hi> is on the other Pillar. I think I told you, that 'tis the Cuſtom of the <hi>Signiory</hi> to erect ſuch Columns in all the Cities under its Dominion.</p>
                     <p>Your Friend has miſinform'd you, who told you, that the three great Banners, which on Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val days are ſet up on the Brazen Pedeſtals over againſt S. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Church, repreſent the State of <hi>Venice</hi> and the two Kingdoms of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Candia.</hi> This, I confeſs, is the generally-receiv'd Opinion, but 'tis as falſe as common; for the Republic's Arms are to be ſeen, without the leaſt difference, on all the three Banners; nor is there any Deſign to repreſent either <hi>Cyprus</hi> or <hi>Candia,</hi> which are not ſo much as nam'd. I cannot comprehend the meaning of thoſe who have aſſur'd you, that the Republick has no Coat of Arms, and that the above-mention'd Lyon is too highly reſpected at <hi>Venice</hi> to be put in a Scutcheon. That ſame Lyon is to be ſeen in all thoſe places where the Arms of the State ought to be: And it is no leſs ridiculous to ſay, that it ſerves inſtead of Arms, but really is no ſuch thing, than it would be to pretend that the <hi>Venetians</hi> wear no Shirts, but that they make
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45740:219"/>
uſe of certain pieces of Linnen, that are cut and ſew'd exactly like our Shirts, which only ſerve them inſtead of Shirts. It cannot be reaſonably ſuppos'd, that the Reſpect they have for their Lyon ſhould hinder them from uſing it for their Arms, ſince we commonly ſee <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixes</hi> apply'd to the ſame uſe. And you know the ſtory of a <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador, who told an Emperor that ask'd him, in what part of the World the Republick had found thoſe <hi>wing'd Lyons</hi> which are to be ſeen in its Coat of Arms, That he believ'd they found them in a certain Country where all the<note n="*" place="margin">Alluding to the Arms of the Empire.</note> 
                        <hi>Eagles</hi> have <hi>two Heads.</hi> Moreover, the Lyon of St. <hi>Mark</hi> derives its original from <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Viſion<note n="†" place="margin">See Vol. <hi>1.</hi>
                        </note>, which I have already mention'd in another place, and not, as you have been inform'd, from a pretended Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſis of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> who was turn'd to a Lyon, to extinguiſh the inceſtuous Love of his Siſter.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. I remember I told you, that the <hi>Air</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> is good; but I muſt confeſs that 'tis very bad in the <hi>Lagunas.</hi> And even I am credibly inform'd, that the Inhabitants of the little Iſles are forc'd to leave their Habitations during the great Heats.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. 'Tis ſo univerſally known, that the <hi>Doge</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> continues for Life, whereas the <hi>Doge</hi> of <hi>Genoua</hi> is chang'd every two years, that I thought it needleſs to inform you of a thing which I preſum'd you knew as well as I.</p>
                     <p>The Revenue of the <hi>Doge</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> amounts to near<note n="*" place="margin">Near Forty thouſand <hi>Livres Tournois.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Three thouſand Pounds Sterl.</hi> according
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45740:219"/>
to my beſt information. The preſent <hi>Doge</hi> is not marry'd. The <hi>Dogeſſes</hi> are excluded from having any ſhare in thoſe ſhadows of Honour which are paid to their Husbands, which is an Effect of the Frugality of the Government; and indeed, the Republick has no need of two Mock-Soveraigns.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. In my former Letters I ſaid nothing, or very little, concerning the <hi>Libertiniſm</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery</hi> that reigns in the Monaſteries, becauſe I am not particularly acquainted with the Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe places. I can only tell you what is generally known and acknowledg'd, That the Nuns receive Perſons in Maſquerade at the Grate; that they put themſelves into all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Diſguiſes, that they go <hi>incognito</hi> to ſee Plays, and elſewhere; that they joyn in publick Feaſts, and have Tables made for that purpoſe, of which one half is within and the other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Grate; that they are concern'd in a thouſand Intrigues, and are often the Principal Actors in them. I leave you to judge of their private Employments, for I am reſolv'd not to pry into them. As for the bouncing <hi>Brothers of the Cowle,</hi> they are ſuch horrible Debauchees, that 'tis impoſſible to fancy any Exceſs of which they are not guilty.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. I am not at all ſurpriz'd at your Friend's Exclamations againſt the Account that I gave you of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Government, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly againſt the Soveraignty of the ancient <hi>Doges;</hi> but let him ſtrut and ſwagger as he pleaſes, 'tis folly either to deny or ſtrive to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45740:220"/>
conceal a thing which is known to all the World.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. According to the Eſtimate which ſome judicious and well inform'd Perſons have made of the Revenues of this Republick, it has been computed, that reckoning one year with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the total ſum of all their Revenues, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending alſo the ſale of <hi>Offices,</hi> and of <hi>Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> Confiſcation of <hi>Eſtates,</hi> and all other caſual Profits, amounts to no more than <hi>Six millions of Crowns.</hi> I will not undertake to warrant the exactneſs of this Calculation, but when you propoſe a Queſtion, you muſt content your ſelf with ſuch an Anſwer as I am able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. There are ſome <hi>Jews</hi> as <hi>Venice</hi> who drive a great Trade, eſpecially the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> who are very rich here, as well as at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and elſewhere. That part of the City which is allotted to them is call'd <hi>il Ghetto,</hi> or the <hi>Jewry.</hi> They wear Hats cover'd with Scarlet, doubl'd and edg'd with Black; but the poorer ſort uſe wax'd Linnen inſtead of Cloth.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. The number of thoſe <hi>Noblemen</hi> who are capacitated by their Age to be Members of the <hi>Great Council,</hi> may, as I am inform'd, amount to about <hi>One thouſand and Three hundred;</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt one half of them reſide in other places, being employ'd either in Civil and Military Offices, or on Embaſſies to foreign States; ſo that the <hi>Great Council</hi> is uſually compos'd of <hi>Six</hi> or <hi>Seven hundred</hi> Perſons at moſt: Yet even theſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45740:220"/>
are too many, and 'tis partly the numerouſneſs of this Aſſembly that has given occaſion to this Proverb concerning <hi>Venice, Troppo Teſte, troppo Feſte, troppo Tempeſte; Too many Heads, too many Feſtivals, and too many Tempeſts.</hi> Nor are the two laſt parts of this Apophthegm leſs true than the firſt; for the number of <hi>Feſtivals</hi> in <hi>Venice</hi> exceeds thoſe that are obſerv'd in <hi>France</hi> by above a third part; and I am aſſur'd that <hi>Storms</hi> happen very frequently here in the Summer.</p>
                     <p n="10">X.<note place="margin">The Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd in the Year <hi>1289.</hi> and all the Noblemen were regiſter'd in that Liſt.</note> The <hi>Golden Book</hi> which you mention is a bare Catalogue of Names, in which all the Sons of the Noblemen are enroll'd as ſoon as they are born. All the Brothers have an equal Title to Nobility, and enjoy the ſame Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges.</p>
                     <p>Before I leave this Head, I muſt anſwer the Objection that was propos'd to you againſt the account that I gave you of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in which I repreſented them as very haughty and almoſt inacceſſible perſons. Juſtice obliges us to give a reaſonable Interpretation to every thing, and 'tis a ridiculous Victory that is obtain'd over imaginary Foes. 'Tis certain, that the Noblemen of <hi>Venice</hi> are extreamly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of their Nobility; nor will the Politicks of that Country permit them to be very affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 'Tis not an eaſie matter for a <hi>Stranger,</hi> whoſe Quality diſtinguiſhes him from the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, to get acceſs to them at their Houſes, for they are only willing to be ſeen at the <hi>Broglio:</hi> Beſides, tho' they cannot be accus'd of ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringneſs in their <hi>Salutations,</hi> yet they uſually treat the Citizens with a great deal of coldneſs,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45740:221"/>
and appear always very reſerv'd in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: Neither are they wont to give and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Viſits, even among themſelves. Thus you ſee that the Character that I gave of them was not ſo injurious to them as ſome perſons would have perſwaded you; for all theſe are ſhrewd ſigns that they do not abound in Courteſie: Nevertheleſs it muſt be acknowledg'd, that in private, when their Conveniency permits them, or at leaſt when their Intereſt obliges them, they can be as kind and civil as any Men whatſoever. Neither is it altogether impoſſible for a <hi>Stranger</hi> to obtain the Favour of a familiar Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with them, eſpecially when both the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman and the Foreigner are perſons of no great note. Moreover, I would not have you imagin that I deſign'd only to break a Jeſt when I told you that the <hi>great Sleeve</hi> does ſometimes ſerve inſtead of a Basket, when a Nobleman goes to the Market; for I once ſaw a large Sallad, and at another time a delicate Tail of a Cod thus honourably lodg'd. I know not whether I did not forget to tell you, that there are Two or Three hundred poor<note n="*" place="margin">They are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Barnabotes</hi> from the name of the place where they live, which is in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote corner of the City, where the Houſes are to be let at low rates.</note> 
                        <hi>Barnabotes,</hi> who beg about the Streets, and inſtead of being at the charge of a <hi>Penny</hi> for the carriage of their ſmall <hi>Proviſions,</hi> would willingly turn <hi>Porters</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and earn a <hi>Penny</hi> by carrying the <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> of others. Theſe poor Gentlemen ſerve for a Foil to the rich Noblemen.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that in the Summer the Noblemen take away the Furs from that which you call the Veſt, and we in French <hi>la Robe;</hi> but the Edges, and that part which is turn'd up, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtill furr'd.</p>

                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:45740:221"/>XI. It was not Ignorance of your Inclination, or rather Love to Painting, that made me guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that Negligence with which you upbraid me, in giving you ſo imperfect an account of thoſe curious Pieces that are to be ſeen at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice;</hi> however, in obedience to your deſire, I ſhall endeavour in ſome meaſure to ſupply that Defect, by adding ſome new Obſervations, tho' I'm afraid my Memory will not furniſh me with many.</p>
                     <p>There were formerly in the Hall of the Great Council ſome Pictures, done by <hi>Gentilis Bellini,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> his Brother, which excell'd the beſt Pieces of that<note n="*" place="margin">

                        </note> Hiſtories were copied five years after, by <hi>Frederick Zuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chero,</hi> and ſet up again in the ſame order in which they ſtill remain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pordenone</hi>'s Pictures in <hi>Freſco,</hi> in the Cloyſter of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> are very much eſteem'd; as are likewiſe his S. <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> and S. <hi>Roch,</hi> at <hi>S. John de Rialto. Pordenone</hi> was an excellent Painter; his Deſigns are eſteem'd very judicious, and his Colours admirably well laid. He emulated <hi>Titian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>St. Peter Martyr</hi> of <hi>Titian</hi> is reputed to be one of the fineſt Pictures that ever was made, but it begins to be much defac'd. The beſt Judges are charm'd with this Piece, tho' it has loſt almoſt all that luſtre which is wont to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh an unskilful Eye. They think they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enough admire the Beauty and Richneſs of the Colours, the judicious Diſpoſition of the Lights, the Roundneſs of the Figures, the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45740:222"/>
and Life that is obſerv'd in the Face, and that ſtrength of Expreſſion which reigns thro' the whole piece. There are ſeveral other Pictures by the ſame hand in the Churches, St. <hi>Mark's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi> the Library, Convents, and Fraternities.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo ſome Pieces by <hi>Schiavoni,</hi> in the Library, which have been frequently taken for <hi>Titian</hi>'s: <hi>Horace Vecelli</hi> his Son has almoſt equal'd him on ſome occaſions; and the Picture in the Hall of the Great Council, which repreſents the Battel fought by the <hi>Romans</hi> againſt the Troops of <hi>Frederick,</hi> is the Work of <hi>Horace,</hi> tho' it be commonly aſcrib'd to his Father.</p>
                     <p>The Picture of the Marriage at <hi>Cana,</hi> by <hi>Paul Veroneſe,</hi> in the Refectory of the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks in the <hi>Iſle of S. George,</hi> is eſteem'd to be the Maſter-piece of that Painter, who, you know, is famous for the ſame Excellencies that we admire in <hi>Titian:</hi> His Works are particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remarkable for the beautiful diſpoſition of the Figures, judicious Choice of Colours, a great <hi>Genius,</hi> vaſt Ideas, the greateſt Eaſineſs imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and the moſt charming Variety.

                     <p>The <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> by <hi>Tintoret,</hi> in the Hall of the Great Council, is a famous Piece. It was ſaid of

                        <hi>Tintoret,</hi> That he united the Deſigns of <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> with the Colours of <hi>Titian;</hi> which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was a very noble Character. Beſides, he had the moſt fruitful Invention, and the quickeſt Hand of all the Artiſts of that Age. A <hi>Painter</hi> who was with me in the Fraternity, or (as they call it at <hi>Venice</hi>) the <hi>School of S.

                     <p>There are ſome of <hi>Baſſani</hi>'s Works at <hi>S. Mary major: Schiavoni</hi>'s Pictures in the Library are, I think, Emblems of <hi>Valour, Soveraignty,</hi> and <hi>Sanctity.</hi>

'Tis true, the Noblemen's Wives, during the firſt, and, I ſuppoſe, alſo the ſecond year of their Marriage, are permitted to pleaſe their own Fancy in the choice of Colours for the Habits of their <hi>Gonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers:</hi> This little Favour is granted them at the ſame time that they are ſuffer'd to adorn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their Jewels; but as ſoon as the limited time is expir'd, this Mark of diſtinction ceaſes, and they are never ſuffer'd to reſume

                     <p>No Man that is not in love with Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will dare to affirm, That the <hi>Venetian</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies enjoy greater Liberty than thoſe of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France;</hi> and 'tis impoſſible to alledge the leaſt ſhadow of a Reaſon in confirmation of ſuch a ridiculous Aſſertion.

Their Vizards and Diſguiſes are more prejudicial than advantageous to them, which ſerve only to hide what they would willingly ſhow, and to confound them with the worthleſs and ignoble Crowd. Beſides, this time of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is very ſhort liv'd: And after. all, how can they be capable of enjoying Pleaſure, while they remember a thing that they ought never to forget, that 'tis impoſſible for them to ſtir a Foot without the attendance of thoſe curſed Spies which are more inſupportable to them than the heavieſt Chains; not to mention their Husbands? What is all this pretended Liberty, but a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of that Confinement which they are forc'd to undergo for ten or eleven months in the year? And is not their Condition more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, when they are ſuffer'd to walk without diſturbance from one end of their Chamber to the other? I will not aggravate their Slavery by the oppoſition of that entire Liberty which is enjoy'd by our <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French Ladies,</hi> their

And at the ſame time he inform'd the Gondolier, that he that went aſhore at St. <hi>Nicholas</hi>'s was Mr. St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> himſelf, that the ſecond was St. <hi>George,</hi> and that he himſelf was St. <hi>Mark,</hi> in proper Perſon.

                        </note> without obliging me to give you any other reaſon why I do ſo, than that I muſt follow my Journal thither. This Palace is very beautiful, and contains many Rarities. The Portico's are ſupported by fourſcore and ſixteen Antique Pillars of <hi>Egyptian</hi> Granite. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Pictures in the lower Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there are ſeventeen hundred Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals by the moſt celebrated Maſters: The <hi>Venus</hi> blindfolding <hi>Cupid,</hi> while the <hi>Graces</hi> bring him his Arms, is <hi>Titian</hi>'s, and is eſteem'd the beſt. <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth, who was of this Family, is painted in ſuch fine <hi>Moſaic</hi> Work, that his Picture is ſaid to contain above a million of Pieces: My Calculation aſſures me, that this cannot be true, but, without Criticiſing upon a Trifle, it muſt be acknowledg'd that 'tis an excellent Picture. Here they ſhew'd us a Crucifix of the ſame bigneſs with that of the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> at <hi>Naples,</hi> and aſſur'd us, that this is that famous Original of <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> which I mention'd before. To reconcile this Difference, I think I may affirm, without any ſcruple, that the whole ſtory is a meer Fable.</p>
                     <p>It was the common <hi>People</hi> that gave the name of <hi>Rotonda</hi> to the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> becauſe of the roundneſs of its Figure. When <hi>Boniface</hi> the Fourth dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated this ancient Temple to the <hi>Virgin</hi> and all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45740:228"/>
the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> he nam'd it <hi>S. Maria ad Martyres.</hi> Afterwards ſome other <hi>Pope</hi> would have all the <hi>Saints</hi> in general comprehended with the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</hi> I muſt ingenuouſly acknowledge, that I cannot give you the ſatisfaction you deſire concerning the true reaſon why this Temple was of old call'd the <hi>Pantheon.</hi> Some ſay, that it had that name from the reſemblance between its Figure and that of the Heavens, <hi>Quod forma ejus convexa faſtigiatam Coeli ſimilitudinem oſtenderet.</hi> Others think that it was conſecrated by <hi>Agrippa</hi> to <hi>Jupiter</hi> and all the Gods; or, perhaps to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> only, and to <hi>Cybele</hi> the Mother of the Gods: but after all, my opinion is, that this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie is not well decided.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, there are Niches all round the inſide of the Temple, and I think we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably conjecture, that theſe Niches were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly full of Idols, but this is the only Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that we can draw from them. <hi>Varro</hi> tells us of Thirty thouſand Deities that were worſhip'd at <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Philoſopher <hi>Bruxil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> in his dying Speech to the <hi>Senate,</hi> aſſur'd them, that he had left Two hundred and Eighty thouſand; ſo that there muſt have been a great number of Niches indeed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate all thoſe Deities. Your Niches then will not furniſh you with one Argument to prove that the <hi>Pantheon</hi> was conſecrated to all that multitude of Gods that were ador'd at <hi>Rome.</hi> Tho' this Temple hath loſt its faireſt Ornaments, it is ſtill one of the moſt beautiful and entire antique Edifices in <hi>Italy.</hi> There is to be ſeen at <hi>Caſtle St. Angelo,</hi> of which I ſhall quickly give you ſome account, a Cannon which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45740:228"/>
is a ſeventy pounder, that was made, as well as the four Columns of the great Altar, only of the brazen Nails with which the Roof of the <hi>Portico</hi> was faſten'd.<note place="margin">The two Lyons of Porphyry which are under the <hi>Portico</hi> of the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> did heretofore ſerve to adorn the Front of the Temple of <hi>Iſis. F. Nardin.</hi>
                        </note> The Columns of this <hi>Portico</hi> are of Granite, of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Order, and all of one piece. I meaſur'd them with as much exactneſs as you could deſire: they are not all equally big, but I found that they were fifteen foot in compaſs, within a few inches more or leſs: I give you the meaſure of them in Engliſh feet, and you may judge of the reſt by the proportion that is between each part. That piece of Granite, in which the opening of the great Gate is cut, is alſo of a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable bigneſs; for it is forty foot high, and very near twenty broad.</p>
                     <p>The illuſtrious <hi>Raphael</hi> lies interr'd in this Church: <hi>Bembus</hi> made this beautiful Diſtick to ſerve for his Epitaph;

                        <hi>La Guillitiere</hi> ſays, that the <hi>Pantheon</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi> ſeem'd to him to be a far more magnificent Structure than that of <hi>Rome.</hi> But <hi>Spon</hi> has cenſur'd this Author for fancying the Temple of <hi>Minerva</hi> to be a <hi>Pantheon. Meurſius</hi> had faln into the ſame Error, and their common Miſtake is grounded upon the faulty deſcription which <hi>Theodoſius Zygomala,</hi> whoſe words they only tranſcribe, gives of that famous Temple, in his Letter to <hi>Martin Cruſius,</hi> or perhaps on the name of <hi>Parthenion,</hi> which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> gives it. I
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45740:229"/>
will not exerciſe your patience with tedious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of Churches, but ſhall content my ſelf to communicate to you ſome particular Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations concerning them, as occaſion ſhall offer. That of St. <hi>Peter</hi> is generally eſteem'd to be the largeſt and moſt magnificent Temple in the World: He that would make a right judgment of it, muſt go thither often; he muſt even walk on the top of the Arches, and into the very Ball which is over the Dome, and muſt alſo view the Church which is under Ground. At your firſt entrance you ſee no ſurprizing Objects; the harmony and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Architecture are ſo judiciouſly obſerv'd, and every thing is plac'd ſo exactly where it ought to be, that this unparallel'd Order does rather compoſe the Mind than diſturb its tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity; but the longer you conſider this vaſt Structure, the more indiſpenſably you will find your ſelf oblig'd to admire it. Since you are willing to rely on my Fidelity and Diligence, rather than on thoſe who have already given you ſome dimenſions of this Edifice, I will ſend you the principal of them, as I meaſur'd 'em my ſelf more than once, with the aſſiſtance of skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and experienc'd perſons. You will very much oblige me, by giving me an Account of what reſemblance or difference you ſhall find between theſe Dimenſions and thoſe of your St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s.</p>

Alexander</hi> the Sixth built a Gallery of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication for this very purpoſe: and indeed, ſuch a wicked man as that Pope was, had reaſon to provide for his ſecurity. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. fortified the Caſtle with four <hi>Baſtions,</hi> and gave 'em the Names of the four <hi>Evangeliſts.</hi> There is a Picture in the Chapel, which repreſents <hi>Gregory</hi> the Firſt with his triple Crown proſtrating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before an Angel that appears to him on the top of <hi>Adrian</hi>'s <hi>Mauſoleum,</hi> and puts up his Sword into its Sheath.

                     <p>In the little Arſenal that belongs to this Caſtle we ſaw an Armory full of prohibited Arms, and were inform'd,<note place="margin">The Pope's triple Crown is kept in this Caſtle.</note> that almoſt all thoſe in whoſe poſſeſſion they were ſeiz'd had been

put to death. Among the reſt, they ſhow'd us <hi>Ranuccio Farneſe</hi>'s Piſtols; I believe the Story of 'em will not be unwelcome to you, of which you may take the following brief Account, as I have heard it related by ſeveral perſons here.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth having by repeated Orders expreſly prohibited the carrying of ſecret Arms, was inform'd; that the young Prince <hi>Ranuccio,</hi> Son and Heir of <hi>Alexander Farneſe</hi> Duke of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> and Governor of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> went uſually arm'd with Pocket-piſtols.<note place="margin">Aſperius nihil eſt humili qui ſurgit in altum.</note> The Pope, who was naturally the moſt rigid and ſevere man in the World, joyfully embrac'd all occaſions to diſplay the greatneſs of his Power, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding who might be ſufferers by it. Beſides, the Dutchy of <hi>Parma</hi> being a Fief of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>means, he look'd on that Prince as his Vaſſal: He commanded <hi>Ranuccio</hi> to be arreſted, and to aggravate his Guilt, order'd his Piſtols to be taken from him in one of the Chambers of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Palace, as that Prince was going to deſire an Audience of his Holineſs. <hi>Ranuccio</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately carried to the Caſtle of S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> and the Cardinal <hi>Farneſe</hi> his Uncle left no means uneſſay'd to procure his Liberty, but all in vain. Whether the <hi>Pope</hi> had reſolv'd on the Death of that poor <hi>Prince,</hi> or only intended to terrifie him, is a Queſtion which I cannot determine. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, about Ten o'th' clock at night, at the ſame time that the Cardinal was return'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his ſollicitations, <hi>Sixtus</hi> ſent an expreſs Command to the Governor of the Caſtle to cauſe <hi>Ranuccio</hi> to be beheaded; and not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that his Orders had been inſtantly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, he rid himſelf of the Cardinal, by grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45740:238"/>
him a new Order to the Governor, by which he commanded him to ſet <hi>Ranuccio</hi> (whom he concluded to be already dead) at liberty at Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven o'th' clock. The Cardinal, who was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the firſt Order, ran to the Caſtle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſing a moment, and was extreamly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd to find his Nephew all in Tears, in the Arms of a Confeſſor, and to hear that his Death had been only delay'd, becauſe he had begg'd a little time to prepare himſelf for it. The Governor ſeeing this new Order, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the Pope had at laſt yielded to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate ſollicitations of the Cardinal, deliver'd up his Priſoner, who, by his Uncle's Command, immediately took poſt, and ſo eſcap'd from the very Jaws of Death.</p>
                     <p>The Cavalier <hi>Borri,</hi> a <hi>Milaneſe</hi> Gentleman, who is a great Chymiſt, and expert Phyſician, is at preſent a Priſoner in the Caſtle of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo;</hi> he is accus'd of ſome Heretical Opinions, but at the ſame time 'tis believ'd, that he is not perfectly Maſter of his Reaſon, which is the cauſe that he is not kept under a very cloſe confinement, and even is ſometimes permitted to viſit perſons of Quality in the City, who deſire his aſſiſtance for the cure of their Diſtempers. We were inform'd, that he pretends to revive the Errors of the <hi>Collyridians</hi> in the Fourth Age, who paid a ſort of Adoration to the <hi>Virgin;</hi> and 'tis even reported, that he makes her a fourth perſon in the Godhead.</p>
                     <p>This man puts me in mind of Dr. <hi>Molinos,</hi> of whom you deſire me to ſend you ſome certain News, which 'tis impoſſible for me to do. 'Tis true, I have ſeen thoſe Propoſitions that are

either heretical, or pretended to be ſo, of which he is ſaid to be the Author; nor would it be very difficult to obtain a Copy of his Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but all this ſignifies nothing. I muſt hear <hi>Molinos</hi> himſelf, before I can judge of the merit of his cauſe: for, 'tis certain, that all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts that we have of him are guilty either of Aggravation or Alleviation. Of theſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which I mention'd, ſome are dangerous, ſeveral are ambiguous, many indifferent, and others very reaſonable and orthodox. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I can aſſure you, that his Reputation is generally very bad in this place: He is eſteem'd a Villain, a lewd Fellow, and a Seducer, who has ſo cunningly inſinuated himſelf into Nunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by his Cant of <hi>Inſenſibility, Extaſie, &amp;c.</hi> that a great number of theſe poor Creatures have been deluded by him. They relate a thouſand Stories to confirm the Opinion they have of him, but I muſt tell you once more that they are of doubtful Credit. We may eaſily perceive that 'tis their Intereſt to blacken the Character of that unhappy Man, and to load him with Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſince they have condemn'd him in ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious a manner to paſs the reſt of his days in a Cell. Beſides, I obſerv'd, that even his bitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Enemies are wont to make a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his Followers. <hi>Molinos,</hi> they ſay, is void of all Religion and Virtue; he is a man of no Principles, and believes nothing at all, but there are ſome well-meaning <hi>Moliniſts,</hi> who are unacquainted with their Maſter's Heart, and are ſincere Profeſſors of that <hi>Quietiſm,</hi> and thoſe other Opinions, which you have heard ſo often mention'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>THAT I may obſerve ſome Order in that variety of Matter which is the Subject of my Letters, I follow ſometimes my own Journal, and ſometimes yours. Some days ago <hi>M. B.</hi> made his Court to the Heroin, whom you mention, and was receiv'd with a great deal of Civility and Reſpect. The Company began immediately to talk of <hi>England,</hi> of its Court, the Excellency of the Country, the various Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of the Inhabitants, and particularly the Liberty that is allow'd to the Women; the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their eaſie and pleaſant manner of living in that Country to the perpetual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of the poor <hi>Italian</hi> Ladies, made the condition of theſe laſt ſeem doubly miſerable. It was however alledg'd, That this Cuſtom which appears to be ſo injurious to the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sex, is a neceſſary piece of Caution in <hi>Italy,</hi> where three quarters of the Men living under the inſupportable reſtraint of a forc'd Celibacy, would make a dreadful havock of their Neighbor's Property, if ſome means were not us'd to prevent ſuch Diſorders. Why do we not then take St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Advice, reply'd one of the company, who exhorts every Man to have his own Wife, and every Woman her
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45740:240"/>
own Husband? But leſt we ſhould have been inſenſibly engag'd in <hi>Controverſie,</hi> by continuing to talk on that Subject, the Diſcourſe was dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly charg'd: And the Queen being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, that there was a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman in the company, ask'd News concerning the late Miſſion of Dragoons; and after ſhe had atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively heard his Anſwer<note n="*" place="margin">You may ſee the Letter which that Princeſs wrote on this Subject to the Chevalier <hi>de Terlon.</hi> It is inſerted in the <hi>Nouvelles de la Republique des Lettres,</hi> May <hi>1686.</hi>
                        </note>, <q>I knew all that you have told me, ſaid ſhe, and have learn'd much more from the Mouths of Eye-witneſſes; and even <hi>Jeſuites</hi> themſelves have given me an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of<note n="†" place="margin">Not many months ago ſome <hi>German Jeſuits</hi> told me, ſaid the Queen, that they had ſeen Dragoons, <hi>Priapos ſuos immanes in os faeminarum intromittentes, ibique urinam fundentes.</hi> I chid 'em ſeverely, added ſhe, for ſuffering ſuch horrible Inſolency, but they only laugh'd at it.</note> infamous Villanies; <hi>They have added Scoffing and Inſolency to Treachery and Barbarity.</hi>
                        </q>
After theſe words, and ſome particular Stories relating to the ſame Subject, we diſcours'd of the Pope, of his Health, and of his famous Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>France</hi> about the <hi>Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi> and at length the Queen withdrew.</p>
                     <p>You are not ignorant of the Learning and Merit of this Princeſs, but ſince you deſire me to give you ſome account of her Perſon, I will make her Picture in few words. She is above ſixty years of age, of a very low ſtature, extreme fat and thick: her Complexion, Voice, and Countenance are maſculine, her Noſe is great, her Eyes are large and blew, and her Eyebrows yellow; ſhe has a double Chin ſtrew'd with ſome long Hairs of a Beard, and her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Lip ſticks out a little. Her Hair is of a bright Cheſnut colour, about a hand-breadth long, powder'd and briſtl'd up, without any
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45740:240"/>
Head-dreſs; ſhe has a ſmiling Air, and is very obliging. As for her Habit, imagine a Man's <hi>Juſtaucor</hi> of black Sattin, reaching to the Knee, and button'd quite down; a very ſhort black Coat, which diſcovers a Man's Shoe; a great knot of black Ribbon inſtead of a Cravat, and a Girdle above the <hi>Juſtaucor,</hi> which keeps up her Belly, and makes its roundneſs fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                     <p>After the Queen had left us, we viſited the principal Apartments of her<note n="*" place="margin">She lives in the Palace <hi>Riari.</hi>
                        </note> Palace, where we found a great number of Pictures and other Antique Pieces of rare and exquiſite beauty; I ſhall only name ſome part of 'em to you at preſent; as, the <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> of Oriental Alabaſter, tranſparent as Amber; the Head and Feet are additional Pieces, of Braſs gilt, but the reſt is very entire. The ſixteen ancient Columns of <hi>Giallo,</hi> with two Pillars of Oriental Alabaſter ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven foot high, the fineſt Agat cannot look fairer. The <hi>Venus,</hi> which might contend for the Golden Apple with that at <hi>Florence,</hi> if her Legs had not been mangl'd by that general Devourer, Time. 'Tis true, they have ſupply'd theſe Defects by the addition of new pieces, which are ſo admirably well fitted to the reſt, that 'tis almoſt impoſſible to perceive that they have been added. The <hi>Caſtor and Pollux</hi> on each ſide of their Mother <hi>Leda,</hi> all of one piece of Marble; the Sons are bigger than the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſhe has but one of her <hi>Eggs.</hi> The Altar of <hi>Bacchus</hi> of fine white Marble, and adorn'd with excellent Sculptures in <hi>Baſſo relievo.</hi> I took notice of the old <hi>Silenus,</hi> who has carous'd ſo briskly at the Feſtival of his Foſter-child, that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45740:241"/>
he is not able to walk without Supporters. I obſerv'd alſo the <hi>Bacchantes</hi> in the poſture of mad Women, ſome of which are playing on Pipes, like the <hi>Fawn</hi> on the Veſſel at <hi>Cajeta.</hi> In another corner there is a<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Baccho Caper omnibus aris Coeditur.</hi> All <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s Altars reek with Blood of Goats. Of old humane Victims were offer'd to him; but after his Voyage to <hi>India,</hi> that Cuſtom was aboliſh'd, and inſtead of Men, they ſacrific'd only Aſſes and Goats.</note> 
                        <hi>Goat</hi> flay'd alive for brouſing on Father <hi>Liber</hi>'s Vines; and a Boar, who is waſh'd in order to be ſacrific'd.</p>
                     <p>Among the <hi>Pictures,</hi> I ſhall only take notice of the Amours of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the ſhape of a Swan, with <hi>Leda,</hi> which is one of the fineſt pieces of <hi>Correge.</hi> The <hi>Virgin,</hi> with the Infant <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and the little St. <hi>John</hi> by <hi>Raphael,</hi> and <hi>Danae</hi> by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rachio.</hi> There are alſo many other <hi>Pictures</hi> by the ſame Hands, and ſome by <hi>Titian, Paul Veroneſe, Guido,</hi> and ſeveral other famous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
                     <p>It would be an endleſs Labour to deſcribe all the rare <hi>Medals</hi> that we ſaw in this Palace, but ſince I promis'd to leave no ſubject wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd, I ſhall only name the <hi>Otho</hi> of Braſs an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Medal, which has on the reverſe the Image of <hi>Serapis;</hi> the <hi>Pertinax,</hi> a little <hi>Latin</hi> Medal, on the reverſe of which that Emperor is repreſented offering a Sacrifice; the <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> having on the reverſe <hi>Hercules</hi> ſitting and <hi>Diana</hi> ſtanding; another <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> being a little <hi>Latin</hi> Medal, which has on the reverſe the ſame Emperor crown'd by <hi>Victory</hi> and <hi>Abundance,</hi> bringing him Fruit: this Medal has been well kept, and is in very good condition, in which its value principally conſiſts: a third little <hi>Latin</hi>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:45740:241"/>
Medal of the ſame <hi>Antonin,</hi> which M. <hi>Bellori</hi> calls <hi>l' Anno nuovo,</hi> or the <hi>New Year,</hi> by reaſon of the four Letters on the reverſe, A. N. F. F. which he interprets <hi>Annum novum, fauſtum, faeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem:</hi> and the <hi>Nero,</hi> a <hi>Latin</hi> Medal, with <hi>Hercules</hi> on the reverſe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cicero</hi> a <hi>Brooch</hi> of <hi>Onyx</hi> being a white Head on a brown Ground, is one of the moſt valuable pieces in this Cabinet.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall paſs from theſe Rarities to others of a different ſort. In St. <hi>Sabina</hi>'s Church on <hi>Mount Aventine</hi> they ſhew a great <hi>Stone,</hi> which the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> of <hi>Colen</hi> hurl'd from the top of the arched Roof, with a deſign to knock out poor St. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic</hi>'s Brains: which he did out of ſpight, if our Informers do not bely the Devil, becauſe he had fail'd in his attempt to beat down the Chapel of the Three Kings.</p>

And S. <hi>Roch</hi>'s Bowl may be ſeen at S. <hi>Marcel</hi>'s. They tell us alſo, that ſome Beams of the <hi>Star</hi> that conducted the <hi>Wiſe Men</hi> were formerly preſerv'd, with the Horns of <hi>Moſes;</hi> but 'tis long ſince theſe Rays were eclipſed or evaporated, as well as the ſound of the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Bells; and <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Horns were tranſported to <hi>Genoua,</hi> where (if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the common report) they are ſtill ſafely preſerv'd.</p>
                     <p>The Navel of Chriſt is at <hi>S. Maria del Popolo:</hi> The ſtory of that Church's Foundation is very pleaſant.

'Tis true, every Order has a particular Way of Preaching: The <hi>Jeſuites</hi> are eſteem'd very good Declaimers, and their Geſture is not ſo extravagant as that of other Monks; but their Stile is the moſt fantaſticall. The <hi>Capuchins</hi> are everlasting Thunderers, and preach nothing but Death and Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it be not a day ſet apart for Buffoonry. Hell, Purgatory, and the Laſt Judgment are the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of almost all their Diſcourſes. They pull their Beards, clap their Hands, and roar out hideouſly. I found t'other day a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Remark, in a Book that treats on this Subject; the Author of which aſſures us, that always when a <hi>Capuchin</hi> preaches the Dogs run out of the <hi>Church.</hi>
                        </note> Preaching, and, you might have added alſo, of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. The Preachers here, generally ſpeaking, are meer makers of wry Mouths and ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Faces. They have indeed ſome natural Endowments that have a tendency to ſome parts of Oratory, but they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ignorant of ſublime Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. All their Motions are extravagant Agitations of the Body, or apiſh Tricks; the variation of the Tone of their Voice throws 'em from the loudeſt Treble to the loweſt Baſe twenty times in a quarter of an hour; and their Diſcourſes have neither Strength nor Gravity. They bawl, they tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment themſelves, their Pulpits are for the moſt part like ſo many Balconies, where they run about with a great deal of Noiſe and Hear, but there is neither Senee nor Reaſon in all this. They are perfect ſtrangers to that admirable way of pronunciation, which by an agreeable and well-order'd mixture of ſoftneſs and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency does at once charm, and move, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh the Souls of the Hearers: And beſides, their whole Diſcourſes do uſually conſiſt of a ridiculous Medley of inſipid Jeſts and childiſh Tales. I heard a <hi>Carmelite</hi> the other day, who
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45740:245"/>
in a Sermon that he preach'd before the <hi>penitent Whores</hi> of the <hi>Holy Croſs,</hi> concerning <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> ſet his Fancy on a furious gallop. In order to diſplay the Merit of that Sacrifice which his Penitent made of the Pleaſures of the World, he ſpent at leaſt a quarter of an hour in paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her forth as the moſt charming Creature under Heaven. He forgot not the leaſt Feature of the compleateſt Beauty, and ſpoke rather like a skilful <hi>Painter</hi> than a <hi>Preacher.</hi> Perhaps alſo he imitated <hi>Perrin del Vague,</hi> who was wont al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt always to make the <hi>Picture</hi> of his Miſtriſs, when he had a mind to deſcribe any beautiful Lady in a Hiſtory.</p>

As bold an Undertaker as <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. was, and how eagerly ſoever he ſtrove to purge <hi>Rome</hi> of that kind of Cattel, you know he was never able to compaſs his Deſign; and even after he had baniſh'd the lewdeſt of 'em, he was forc'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call 'em, and ſettle e'm again, with as much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity as they had been by his Nameſake <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> IV.

                     <p>This puts me in mind of the ancient Picture of a Wedding at the <hi>Aldobrandin</hi> Palace: 'Tis a piece of a<note n="*" place="margin">Or the broad Band under the Corniſh.</note> Frize, which has been brought hither with that part of the Wall on which it is painted. It is a famous and much valued piece, both for its Antiquity, and the excellency of the Workmanſhip. You know that the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Marriage were very different, and ſubject to many alterations among the <hi>Romans:</hi> here the Bride is ſeated on the ſide of the Bed, whereas ſhe was ſometimes wont to ſit on a Sheep's Fleece, or on a Figure of the God <hi>Priapus;</hi> ſhe bows down her Head, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits a certain Grief and Coyneſs, whilſt a <note n="†" place="margin">Pronula,</note> Matron with a ſmiling countenance comforts, inſtructs, and perſwades her, and labours to make her ſenſible of her Duty. The Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, crown'd with Ivy, and undreſs'd, ſits near the Bed, with a brisk Air, waiting with a great deal of impatience, I warrant ye, till his whining Spouſe has made an end of all her ſimperings. In the mean time four or five Maids are buſied in ſeveral places, in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Baths</hi> and <hi>odoriferous Oyntments;</hi> and a <hi>She-Muſician</hi> plays on a Harp, whilſt another ſeems to ſing ſome <hi>Hymen io, O Hymenaee,</hi> ſome <hi>Epitha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamium</hi> or luſcious Song to diſpel the Charms.</p>
                     <p>The Pictures on the <hi>Pyramid</hi> of <hi>Ceſtius,</hi> and the above-mention'd <hi>Frize,</hi> are the only Remains of the <hi>Ancient Painting</hi> which I have yet ſeen in <hi>Rome.</hi> I doubt not but this <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoleum</hi> of <hi>Caius Ceſtius</hi> has been already deſcrib'd; yet ſince 'tis a very rare and beautiful Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45740:246"/>
I cannot forbear giving you ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it. The Pyramid is ſquare, and ends in a very ſharp point; it is a hundred and twenty foot high, and ninety four foot broad at the Baſe. The Body of the Monument is of Brick, but cover'd over with ſquare pieces of white Marble. It was repair'd by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Seventh, in the year 1673, and almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely reſtor'd to its primitive Beauty. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, by the fair<note n="*" place="margin">C. Ceſtius. L. F. Pob. Epulo, Pr. Tr. Pl. VII. Vir Epulonum.</note> Inſcriptions that are ſtill to be ſeen upon it, that it was erected in memory of<note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Blondus</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that this Sepulchre was common to the whole Society of the <hi>Septemviri Epulones.</hi> But he is the only perſon that I know who is of this Opinion.</note> 
                        <hi>C. Ceſtius,</hi> one of the ſeven Officers who were appointed to take care of Religious Feaſts. We enter'd this <hi>Mauſoleum</hi> by a low and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row paſſage, which pierces thro' the thickneſs of the Building to the middle of it, where we found a little arch'd Room nineteen foot long, thirteen broad, and fourteen foot high. This Chamber is plaiſter'd over with a certain white and poliſh'd Mortar, on which there are ſtill ſeen ſeveral Figures of Women, Veſſels, and other Ornaments. I will not undertake to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe all theſe things particularly; much leſs will I attempt to write a Diſſertation on ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult a ſubject; I will only tell you, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had the fortune to diſcourſe ſeveral times with learned Antiquaries concerning theſe Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, I found their Opinions very different: ſome pretend, that in reſpect to the Monument they repreſent the Preparatives for a Funeral Show; and others think, that they contain a repreſentation of a Banquet, as a Memorial al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding to the Office of the Deceas'd. One of the Figures holds a Veſſel, in which ſome pour Luſtral Water, and others Wine Another Figure
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45740:246"/>
bears great Pipes, which, according to the firſt Opinion, were deſign'd for Mirth, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the laſt, for Mourning; and both the diſagreeing Parties pretend, with equal proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, to confirm their Suppoſitions by this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick in <hi>Ovid</hi>'s <hi>Faſts:</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>But one thing eſpecially ſeems to confirm the latter Opinion, if I may be permitted to declare my Thoughts on this ſubject, namely, That the Habits of the Figures are of ſeveral colours, which does not at all agree with the Funeral Ceremonies that were us'd in thoſe times. It appears by the Inſcription of a Pedeſtal that was dug up near the Pyramid, and on which a Statue of <hi>Ceſtius</hi> ſeems to have been plac'd, that this <hi>Roman</hi> dy'd in the beginning of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi>'s Reign; and thoſe who have enquir'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cuſtoms of that Age, aſſure us, that the Women who aſſiſted at Burials were cloth'd in white, and that the Faſhion of Mourning in black was aboliſh'd about the beginning of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Dictatorſhip. Beſides, I know not what ſhould hinder me from adventuring to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that theſe Pictures were only deſign'd for an Ornament of the Tomb, without regard ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45740:247"/>
to Feaſt or Funeral.

                     <p>The durableneſs of theſe Pictures, and the laſting beauty of their Colours, deſerve to be conſider'd. You know that<note n="*" place="margin">It was inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                           <hi>Guelderland,</hi> in the year <hi>1450</hi>
                        </note> Painting in Oyl is a late Invention; and it appears that the Colours on this Monument have been only moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten'd with Water, and even do not penetrate the Plaiſter; tho' there are ſome places in which they ſeem to have loſt nothing of their firſt livelineſs.</p>
                     <p>This Pyramid is Two hundred paces diſtant from the little Hill commonly call'd <hi>il Doliolo,</hi> or <hi>Monte Teſtacio,</hi> that is, <hi>The Hill of Potſheards.</hi> This Hillock is about half a mile in compaſs, and a hundred and fifty foot in perpendicular heighth. Thoſe who treat of ſuch Curioſities differ much in their ſuppoſitions concerning this great heap of broken Pots, but the moſt general Opinion is this: The Hillock being near the <hi>Tiber,</hi> 'tis ſuppos'd that all the Potters wrought in this place, both for the nearneſs of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is of neceſſary uſe in their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for the conveniency of tranſporting their Ware. 'Tis alſo believ'd that they threw all the broken pieces of their Veſſels into one place; and this ſuppoſition is confirm'd by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conjecture, That they might have an
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45740:247"/>
expreſs Order for ſo doing, to prevent the inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the River on that ſide. And they conclude, that if we conſider the vaſt number of Idols, Ornaments of Temples, Bathing-tubs, Statues, Vats, Tyles, and all ſorts of Veſſels that were made in the great City of <hi>Rome,</hi> it will not appear ſtrange, that the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Hillock was rais'd out of their Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This ſuppoſition ſeems reaſonable at the firſt view, but, in my opinon, it is not well grounded, becauſe the Authors of it have not examin'd the matter with due attention.</p>
                     <p>Some Wine-Merchants have thought fit to dig Cellars under this Hill, to preſerve their Wines cool: and I have been preſent ſeveral times, and in ſeveral places, when they were at work in digging theſe Caves, ſo that I had both Time and Opportunity to conſider all that they drew out of them, yet I could never find any Fragments of Images, Tyles, or Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor any Remainder, or the leaſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of thoſe things that I mention'd. And in more than twenty Cartloads of theſe broken pieces, I obſerv'd only Fragments of Urns, or at the leaſt of Veſſels that ſeem'd to have been Urns; which being ſuppos'd, we muſt proceed to eſtabliſh more probable Conjectures.</p>
                     <p>'Tis well known, that in ancient times only the pooreſt ſort of People were buried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the City, in certain Pits call'd <hi>Puticuli.</hi> The Cuſtom of burning dead Bodies continu'd very long, during which time there was made a prodigious quantity of Earthen Urns for the ordinary ſort of people; and 'tis impoſſible to conceive that all the care that was taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45740:248"/>
'em could prevent their being frequently broken. May it not then be ſuppos'd, that out of reverence to thoſe Veſſels, which had been employ'd to ſo ſacred an uſe, and might ſtill contain ſome part of the Aſhes of the Dead, that ſuperſtitious people eſteem'd it a Duty of Religion to gather all theſe Fragments, and lay 'em in heaps together? Neither ſhould ſuch a Cuſtom appear ſtrange to us, ſince 'tis ſo little different from the common practice of Chriſtians at this very day: for, inſtead of ſuffering the Bones of deceas'd perſons, that are dug up when a new Grave is made, to be ſcatter'd about, do we not endeavour to preſerve 'em with ſome ſort of Honour and Reſpect, by piling them up in heaps?</p>

                        <hi>Marforio</hi> is another maim'd Figure, by ſome ſaid to have been a Statue of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to others, of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> or of the <hi>Nera,</hi> which paſſes by <hi>Terni;</hi> but all this is uncertain, as well as the Etymology of the Names of our two Cenſurers. 'Tis very probable that it was formerly the Mode to affix the <hi>Paſquinades</hi> on the Statue of <hi>Paſquin,</hi> but that Cuſtom is laid aſide, and all the Satyrical Invectives are ſtill father'd on <hi>Paſquin,</hi> tho' they never come near him.

                     <p>I'm ſorry that I cannot relate to you ſo many Wonders of <hi>Tivoli</hi> and <hi>Freſcati</hi> as you ſeem to expect. They are indeed very <hi>pleaſant</hi> places, and rather than give offence, I will e'en adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to call 'em <hi>fine places.</hi> But, if once this Maxim be eſtabliſh'd, That when we conſider things which are reputed beautiful, we ought
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45740:253"/>
to proportion the Eſteem that we have for 'em, by comparing 'em one with another; as, the beauty of Roſes and Gilliflowers does ſo darken the fainter luſtre of a Field-Daiſie, that we paſs by it without reflexion. If, I ſay, this Principle be laid down, I muſt ſincerely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that if we compare <hi>Freſcati</hi> to <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles,</hi> or even to ſeveral other pleaſant Seats in <hi>France,</hi> that are not Royal Houſes, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, and dare poſitively affirm, that the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Wonders not only of <hi>Freſcati,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Tivoli,</hi> and all the moſt beautiful places about <hi>Rome,</hi> I mean as to Gardens and Water-works, deſerve no higher Title than that of <hi>Pretty Toys.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Freſcati</hi> is a very ſmall Town,<note place="margin">FRESCATI, <hi>anciently call'd</hi> Tuſculum.</note> ſeated on the Brow of a Hill, twelve miles from <hi>Rome.</hi> There are ſeveral Houſes of Pleaſure in it, of which the three principal are <hi>Monte-dracone,</hi> belonging to the Prince <hi>Borgheſe, Belvedere</hi> to the Prince <hi>Pamphilio,</hi> and the <hi>Villa Ludoviſia</hi> to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Guadagnola</hi> the Conſtable <hi>Colonna</hi>'s Siſter; and all deſerve no more to be compar'd to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> than <hi>Freſcati</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> or two or three Trees to a fine Landskip.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Monte-dracone</hi> is a large Structure, ſituated on a riſing Ground, from which you may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover <hi>Rome</hi> and the whole extent of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Plain; but that City is at too great a diſtance to be ſeen from hence with pleaſure, and the Verdure of the Plain is too uniform and unadorn'd with that variety of Beauties with which a Landskip ought to be embelliſh'd. The view of <hi>Paris</hi> from <hi>S. Clou</hi> is infinitely
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45740:254"/>
more charming. 'Tis true, the Proſpect is more diverſify'd on the ſide of <hi>Monte-Porcio,</hi> but 'tis alſo much more limited. The Avenues of this Houſe are very difficult; and, to ſpeak plainly, there are at preſent neither Fountains nor Gardens about it, that merit a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation of <hi>Belvedere</hi> is not unlike to that of <hi>Monte-dracone.</hi> There is a pretty Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade in it, and a Grotto, where you may ſee <hi>Apollo</hi> with the <hi>Nine Muſes</hi> on Mount <hi>Parnaſſus.</hi> We were inform'd, that all theſe Statues play'd on Pipes, when the Machins were in order.</p>
                     <p>The Caſcade at the <hi>Villa Ludoviſia</hi> is alſo the principal Ornament of its Garden. The Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of all theſe three Houſes is mean; and every thing about 'em appears neglected.</p>

                        <hi>Tivoli</hi> is another little Town, ſeated on a Hillock, eighteen miles from <hi>Rome;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> has a Houſe of Pleaſure in it, which is commonly call'd the Cardinal <hi>d' Eſte</hi>'s <hi>Palace,</hi> becauſe it is ſet apart for the uſe of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of that Family, when there are any. This <hi>Palace</hi> is large, and makes a handſom ſhow, but has neither fine Apartments nor Furniture. The greateſt Rarities that it can boaſt of, are three Chambers painted in <hi>Freſco,</hi> by <hi>Raphael,</hi> with ſome ancient Statues. The Garden is not very large, but it is embelliſh'd with pleaſant Terras-walks and Water-works, which far exceed thoſe at <hi>Freſcati,</hi> and are even thought to excel all the Works of that nature in <hi>Italy:</hi> but the greateſt part of the Canals are unfortunately ſtopp'd, the Machins out of order, and the

'Twould be certainly very unjuſt to refuſe the Praiſes that are due to a place, which if it be conſider'd ſingly and by its ſelf, muſt be acknowledg'd to have a great many Charms, and to contain a great number of Curioſities: Neither do I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in the leaſt to derogate from its true value: My deſign is only to give a juſt Idea of it, and to remove thoſe Prejudices with which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons are poſſeſs'd concerning it. I will not ſtrive to refute the Opinion of thoſe who believe that the Gardens and Water-works of <hi>Italy</hi> did formerly ſurpaſs thoſe of <hi>France;</hi> but ſince the Face of Affairs is alter'd, we ought alſo to change our Language. I muſt confeſs I was ſtrangely ſurpriz'd at the ſight of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Curioſities of this Country, after I had heard the Water-works of <hi>Italy</hi> ſo extravagant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended, as if there had been nothing in the Univerſe that could with Juſtice be compar'd to 'em. They tell us, that the <hi>Palace</hi> and <hi>Gardens</hi> of <hi>Eſte</hi> coſt Three millions, and I will not pretend to contradict 'em, but I muſt beg leave to aſſure them, that <hi>Verſailles</hi> has incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Beauties; that the Water-works of that place exceed a million of ſuch as thoſe that are at <hi>Tivoli;</hi> and that the very Lead of the Canals at <hi>Verſailles</hi> coſt ten times more than all <hi>Tivoli.</hi>

                     <p>Theſe Quarries put me in mind of a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Accident related by <hi>Alexander Taſſoni,</hi> in his <hi>Various Thoughts,</hi> an account of which will not be unpleaſant to you.

It reſembles a Pond, being almoſt round, and Two hundred paces in diameter: its Water is extream clear, and ſeems to be of a very blew colour.

The late Cardinal <hi>d' Eſte</hi> having in vain attempted to ſound the depth of this Lake, perſwaded two Divers to enter into it, one of whom was never after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſeen, and the other related, that he found the Water ſo hot, tho' at the ſurface it is cold, that he was not able to deſcend to any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable depth. The Land is dry and hollow underneath about the Banks of the Lake, as it appears by the deaf ſound made by the tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Horſes upon it. 'Tis probable that the viſible part of the Lake is only a narrow Mouth of a vaſt Abyſs, which widens and extends it ſelf under Ground very far on both ſides. And I think it may be conjectur'd concerning the firſt Diver, that either he ventur'd too deep, and was ſurpriz'd by the heat of the Water, or that having wander'd into ſome ſubterraneous Gulf, he ſtruck his Head againſt the impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arch, inſtead of riſing at the Mouth of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45740:256"/>
the Lake. But not to inſiſt upon the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, we muſt neceſſarily conclude, that the Body was carried into ſome ſubterraneal Vault, ſince it never afterwards appear'd on the ſurface of the Water.</p>
                     <p>On the Bank of this Lake we ſaw certain old Ruins, which Antiquaries call the Baths of <hi>Agrippa.</hi> The largeſt of the floating Iſlands makes a perfect Oval, and is about fifteen foot long; they are ſtill crowded together on that ſide whither the Wind drives 'em; and the leaſt touch puts 'em in motion. Two of our Company went into one of the ſmalleſt of 'em, and puſh'd it from the Land only by thruſting againſt the Bank with the points of their Swords.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Villa Borgheſe</hi> is, in my Opinion, kept in better order than any that I have hitherto ſeen. 'Tis certainly a very pleaſant place, and fit for a great Prince.

                     <p>The <hi>Villa Ludoviſia</hi> is very much out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, by reaſon of the abſence of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Piombino,</hi> who is Lord of it.

In the ſame Chamber we ſaw a heap of Bones which, they aſſur'd us, was the Skeleton of a petrefy'd Man; but they are miſtaken, for the Bones are not turn'd to Stone, only they are cover'd over with a candy'd Film, or ſtony Cruſt, which has given occaſion to their Error: Not that I imagine Bones uncapable of Petrefaction, as well as other things, for I believe there is nothing in the World that may not be ſubject to ſuch an alteration. In the ſeveral Cabinets of Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that I have ſeen in my Travels, I have obſerv'd a prodigious Variety of petrefy'd Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Fruits, Flowers, Trees, Wood, Plants, Bones, Fiſhes, Bread, pieces of Fleſh, and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals of all ſorts. <hi>Pareus</hi> relates an Inſtance of a Child that was turn'd to a Stone in the

                     <p>The Gardens of the <hi>Villa Pamphili,</hi> would be in my Opinion the faireſt that I have ſeen, if they were kept in better order: for here I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd a more judicious deſign, more Symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45740:259"/>
and a more regular diſpoſition of all the Parts than any where elſe. The Houſe is adorn'd on the outſide with fine Antique <hi>Baſſo relievo's,</hi> like that of the <hi>Villa Borgheſe,</hi> and it is no leſs repleniſh'd within; but the beſt Statues were very much diſorder'd by an Accident which I ſhall relate to you. The Prince <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philio,</hi> while he was yet very young, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately ſollicited by the Jeſuites to enter into their Society. He was not altogether averſe to this motion, and thoſe deſigning Fathers em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd all their Cunning to gain him under a Pretext of Devotion, to which they knew he was very much enclin'd. Among other Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems which they us'd, they exclaim'd loudly againſt the Indecency of thoſe naked Marble Figures which he kept in this Palace; and the tender Conſciences of theſe rigid Caſuiſts oblig'd him at length to order ſeveral parts of theſe Statues to be cover'd. This poor young Prince, to humour his ghoſtly Fathers, caus'd Shirts of Plaſter to be put on all his Marble Subjects, Men, Women, and Children. This Reformation was very grievous to ſome perſons, eſpecially to Painters, Sculptors, and Antiquaries, but no humane Conſideration could prevail with the Prieſt-ridden Prince to deſiſt from his pious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to hide ſo many tempting and dangerous Objects. They were all daub'd and plaſter'd over without mercy, ſave one little <hi>Bacchus,</hi> who had the good fortune to eſcape this holy Fury as the young<note n="*" place="margin">He was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made a Duke.</note> Lord of <hi>Force</hi> was preſerv'd from that of the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Maſſacre. A poor <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> one of the Maſterpieces of the famous <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racchio</hi> was ſmutted all over from head to foot,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45740:259"/>
and transform'd into I know not how many Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, which fill at preſent the corner of a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of which ſhe was formerly the faireſt Ornament.</p>
                     <p>But the Prince having at laſt chang'd his Mind, and being reſolv'd to prefer the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of his Princeſs to that of the <hi>Society,</hi> was deſirous to redreſs all theſe Diſorders, and to reſtore his good People to their ancient Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges. In purſuance of this deſign, he order'd the naſty Clay with which they were cover'd to be taken off; but the clumſy-fiſted Maſons had unfortunately mangl'd ſeveral parts of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make their Plaſter ſtick the better; ſo that the greateſt part of theſe curious Pieces were very much damag'd.</p>
                     <p>I muſt not forget to tell you, that I obſerv'd at the <hi>Villa Savelli,</hi> an unuſual Figure of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s <hi>Sacrifice</hi> by <hi>l'Eſpagnolet;</hi> for, whereas <hi>Iſaac</hi> is commonly painted on his Knees, and blind-folded, and his Father with a ſhort two-handed Sword, like a <hi>Switzer</hi>'s, or with a Turkiſh Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitar, ready to cut off his Son's Head like a <hi>Frenchman; L'Eſpagnolet</hi> has only given him a plain ſacrificing Knife, as if he were going to cut <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Throat; which certainly agrees better with the Truth of the Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Julius Romanus</hi> was the Architect of the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Houſe of Pleaſure, commonly call'd <hi>Vigne Madame.</hi> This Building is neither great nor magnificent, but its beauty is regular and unaffected, and its ſituation extreamly delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. On one ſide it enjoys a proſpect of <hi>Rome,</hi> with ſeveral Gardens, and many pleaſant Seats;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45740:260"/>
and on the other the Eye is raviſh'd with a beautiful Landskip of little and well cultivated Hills: over-againſt it the <hi>Tiber</hi> creeps thro' the Fields and Meadows; and at a diſtance the Snowy tops of the <hi>Appennin</hi> do inſenſibly mingle with the Clouds: behind it is a ſhady Wood of tall Trees, adorn'd with cool and ſolitary Walks, which are incomparably charming. The Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens riſe into Terras-walks, and want neither Fountains nor Statues.</p>

                     <p>I ſhall begin this Letter by anſwering the Queſtions you Propoſe concerning the <hi>Tiber.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Tiber</hi> was formerly call'd <hi>Rumon, Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and <hi>Albula.</hi> It receives forty Rivers before its arrival at <hi>Rome, Martian.</hi>
                        </note> 'Tis certain that this River has nothing in its ſelf that could have render'd it ſo famous as it has been; and without doubt it ows the Honour it has to be ſo generally known, to the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Noble City which it waters, unleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome part of its Fame may be aſcrib'd to the noiſe which its frequent Inundations have made in the World: Nevertheleſs it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd that it has been often treated with too much contempt; the great Rivers are jealous of its Glory, and would have it paſs for a muddy Brook, ſuch as I perceive it has been repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you. But you may rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon that,<note place="margin">The Bridg of <hi>S. Angelo</hi> is <hi>330</hi> foot long; and that of <hi>Sixtus 300.</hi> Some Antiquaries affirm that it was not lawful to build Houſes on the Banks of the <hi>Tiber,</hi> out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to that ſacred River. But this is an Error, which might be eaſily refuted. <hi>Clandian</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Authors have left poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive accounts of the great number of noble Structures that were erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Banks of this River. The greateſt Inundation happen'd under <hi>Clement VIII.</hi> in the Month of <hi>December 1598.</hi>
                        </note> by a general Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the breadth of the <hi>Tiber</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> amounts to about three hundred Feet; and beſides it is rapid and of a great depth. <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> relates, that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> caus'd it to be cleans'd, and ſomewhat enlarg'd it's Chanel to facilitate it's Courſe. Other Princes have alſo endeavour'd to prevent the Diſorders that attend it's Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, but with little or no Succeſs. The <hi>Sirocco
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45740:261"/>
Levante,</hi> which is the <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> of the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean,</hi> and is here call'd the <hi>Sea Wind,</hi> does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times blow with ſo terrible an Impetuoſity, that it drives back, or at leaſt ſtops, the Waters of the <hi>Tiber</hi> at it's Mouth. And when it happens at the ſame time, that the melted Snow of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pennins</hi> ſwells the Torrents, which fall into that River, or the ſame effect is produc'd by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Rains; the Conjunction of theſe various Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents muſt neceſſarily increaſe its Waters, and cauſe thoſe Inundations, which may be term'd the Scourge of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the fiery Eruptions of <hi>Veſuvius</hi> are call'd the Scourge of <hi>Naples.</hi> There are Inſcriptions faſten'd in ſeveral Places againſt the Walls to denote the Year and Height of the Inundations.</p>
                     <p>The Water of this River is always thick and yellowiſh; but if it be ſuffer'd to ſtand a whole night it grows clear and limpid, and they aſſur'd us alſo that 'tis very good. Nevertheleſs I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that ſome Perſons in all Ages have been at prodigious charge to bring other Waters to <hi>Rome,</hi> in order to which they have diverted the courſe of Rivers, pierc'd Mountains, and built great Aqueducts. And they continue ſtill to make new Attempts to compaſs the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. The <hi>Aqua Felice</hi> was twenty Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from <hi>Rome,</hi> and coſt Pope <hi>Sixtus the</hi> V. near four hundred thouſand Crowns to bring it thither.

There is to be ſeen on the high Altar of the <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Church, that admirable Picture of the <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration</hi> which is the laſt Work and Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of <hi>Raphael.</hi> And not far from hence they viſit with great devotion, the Chapel which is built on the very ſame place where they believe St. <hi>Peter</hi> was crucify'd. In the middle of this Chappel they have made a deep hole where they affirm the Croſs was fixt. You know what <hi>Platina</hi> and others have related that St. <hi>Peter</hi> deſir'd to be crucify'd with his Head down-ward, not eſteeming himſelf worthy to ſuffer in the ſame manner with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Picture of this Crucifixion is to be ſeen at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>at the three Fountains,</hi> by the hand of <hi>Guido:</hi> And in the ſame Church they ſhow the Pillar, on which they pretend St. <hi>Paul</hi> was beheaded. This may ſerve to exerciſe the Wits of thoſe Critics, who are lovers of ſuch Curioſities, to ſhow how a Man could be beheaded on a Pillar.</p>
                     <p>This Column puts me in mind of another, which we ſaw ſome days ago in the Cloyſter of St. <hi>John de Lateran:</hi> 'Tis that on which St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Cock crew. In the ſame place there is another, which was cleft aſunder from top to bottom on the day of the Paſſion. They ſhow alſo the Meaſure of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Height, to which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that never any Perſon was yet found exactly equal. And here they alſo keep the <note n="*" place="margin">It is of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry, four foot long, and three bread.</note>Stone on which <hi>Pilat</hi>'s Soldiers caſt lots for Chriſt's Garments; the Dice, they ſay, are at <hi>

by a Hoſt which flew out of the Hands of an Incredulous Perſon, nor of the other Curioſities that are to be ſeen under the Portico's of this Cloyſter. But I cannot forbear telling you that I have ſeen the bor'd Chair, about which you deſire to be imform'd, that was formerly made uſe of in the Ceremony inſtituted to prevent all doubts concerning<note n="†" place="margin">After the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the Witneſſes, they cry'd with a loud voice, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Whether the Reaſon and End of that ſearch gave occaſion to the ancient uſe of this Chair; or it was made only to put the Popes in mind that they were not Gods, but Men, and ſubject to all human infirmities; or whether that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was ordain'd for both theſe ends together, as <hi>Platina</hi> ſeems to think, who ſpeaks very obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on this occaſion, is a Controverſy which I am as willing as you, to leave undecided. But as for the <hi>She-Pope</hi> I am reſolv'd to take another Courſe, and ſince you have given me a fair oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to add ſome Reflexions to all that has been ſaid, by ſo many different Perſons on this ſubject, I muſt tell you freely, that I find not the leaſt ſolidity either in your Objections, or any of thoſe that have been rais'd by others againſt the Truth of this Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:45740:262"/>'Tis true, ſome <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Authors have reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it as a Fable, as well as the <hi>Roman Catholic</hi> Doctors of theſe laſt Ages: Whether the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer did really eſteem it to be ſuch, or were acted by a Spirit of Singularity, or a certain ſort of Complaiſance which might have been very well ſpar'd, I will not pretend to determine; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man will have his humor: And you muſt not blame me, if I am reſolv'd to believe my own Eyes. Let us conſider the matter of Fact then, and examin the Arguments on both ſides, with all poſſible Brevity.</p>
                     <p>I cannot perceive the leaſt ſhadow of a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that ſhould hinder us from ranking this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture among an infinite number of other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Events recorded in Hiſtory, to which we cannot without Injuſtice refuſe to give credit.

What Folly then, or rather Madneſs muſt we ſuppoſe ſo many grave Authors to have been ſeiz'd with, which could intice 'em to invent a Fable of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with all the Circumſtances that attend it: And what Evidence or Authority can henceforth perſwade us to believe that which we never ſaw.</p>
                     <p>I muſt acknowledg it to be my Opinion, that the aiery and humorous Wit of Incredulity ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made a worſe Figure than on this occaſion.<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45740:263"/>
But you will perhaps tell me that they do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon a bare Negation of the matter of Fact, but that they alledge ſeveral weighty Arguments to confirm their Opinion, which deſerve to be conſidered, and that after a careful and ſerious Examination of the whole Controverſie, they find reaſon to conclude that the Hiſtory of the pretended <hi>She-Pope</hi> is an ill-contriv'd Fable.</p>
                     <p>Very well, Sir, I will hear theſe boaſted Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, immediatly, and perhaps confute 'em too; but firſt give me leave to tell you, that when a matter of Fact which does not imply a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, is poſitively atteſted by ſufficient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; we muſt not pretend to call the Truth of the Hiſtory in queſtion, meerly on the Score of certain Criticiſms, on ſome intricate and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Paſſages in it. In the preſent caſe we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a multitude of Authors of undoubted Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, who confirm the Truth of our Aſſertion; and all your halfdifficulties can never invalidate the Teſtimony of ſo many credible Witneſſes. The controverſie muſt he decided by the force of Authorities; and whatever reluctancy you may have to confeſs your ſelf foil'd, you muſt either quit the Cudgels or defend your ſelf bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>The Queſtion is not whether it would be an eaſy matter at this time of the<note n="*" place="margin">We muſt alſo conſider the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Times.

And ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Popes who have been rais'd to that Dignity from the loweſt degree of Meanneſs.</p>
                     <p>But, you proceed, how can it ſeem probable that a Woman could ſo long hide her great Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and at laſt be ſo much a Fool as to expoſe her ſelf to the Danger of being deliver'd of a Child in the midſt of a ſolemn Proceſſion.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, in the firſt place, that <hi>probable,</hi> or <hi>not probable</hi> 'tis all one to me, ſo long as the thing is <hi>Poſſible.</hi> But ſecondly, as to the firſt part of your Objection, I ſay, that a Woman may contrive ſeveral ways to prevent the Diſcovery of ſuch a Secret, eſpecially when ſhe is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believ'd to be a Man: And if any of your Friends ſhould be troubl'd with a ſwelling in his Belly, would you preſently imagin him to be with Child. In the third place, I ſhall offer two conſiderations in anſwer to what you alledge concerning the Imprudence of our Female Pope. The firſt is, that we ſometimes meet with una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable Difficulties, through which we muſt force a paſſage over all the dangers that attend 'em. And the other is, that we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe that ſhe was come to the end of her ninth Month, when this Misfortune hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd. 'Tis not improbable that ſhe was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd before her due time, or at leaſt the thing is poſſible; which being allow'd, ſhe can neither be accus'd of Imprudence, nor we have any
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45740:265"/>
reaſon to wonder that ſhe was able to conceal her great Belly.</p>

                        <note place="margin">If Chronological Difficulties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Argument againſt the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of Pope <hi>Joan:</hi> By the ſame reaſon we may conclude that ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Popes are meer imaginary Names.</note>But you tell me, that Chronologers do not agree in their calculations about the Time of this accident. 'Tis true they do not, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their difference is obvious. They who expunge our <hi>Popeſs</hi>'s Name out of the Catalogue of Popes, are oblig'd dexterouſly to lengthen the Lives of her Predeceſſors to fill up the Breach which they have made. But as you have Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nological Supputations that are accomodated to your Opinion, ſo I have others that are agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to mine: And therefore our Controverſy muſt be decided by other Arguments.</p>
                     <p>The Objection which is grounded on her Voyage to <hi>Athens,</hi> under pretence that the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that were proſecuted there at that time, were not ſutable to a young Scholar, is a meer frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Cavil. For in the firſt place you ſuppoſe without the leaſt proof, that ſhe was a young Scholar at the time of her Voyage; and what reaſon can you alledge, why I may not ſuppoſe that ſhe was old enough to be admitted among the Hearers of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Philoſophers, or other Profeſſors in that Academy? But ſecondly, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that ſome of thoſe Authors who relate this Hiſtory, carry her ſtraight to <hi>Rome</hi> without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning <hi>Athens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You will perhaps look upon this Conceſſion as very advantageous to your Party, and reproach me with the Contradictions of my Authors; but I can eaſily ward this Blow. Conſider, I beſeech you, that the ſame Action as to the Main is not always related with the ſame Circumſtances; and even <hi>Sacred Hiſtory</hi> might furniſh me with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45740:265"/>
Inſtances of ſuch Variations. I acknowledg indeed, that we ought not to rely upon the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of a Hiſtorian who contradicts himſelf: but tho we ſhould obſerve ſome circumſtantial differences between two Authors who relate the ſame thing, but live perhaps in different Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; we could not in Juſtice give theſe Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the ignominious name of <hi>Contradictions,</hi> but only conclude that they were occaſion'd either by forgetfulneſs, want of neceſſary Intelligence, or ſome Ambiguity in the Expreſſion. Beſides, if there had been a Combination of falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to cheat the World, and if they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately invented the pretended Fable of <hi>Pope Joan;</hi> they would certainly have taken better meaſures, and agree'd upon the Circumſtances of the ſtory. 'Tis plain then, that ſuch petty Variations do not deſtroy, nor ſo much as wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Credit of a Relation.

And I muſt likewiſe add, that tho we could not find the leaſt mention of a <hi>Female Pope</hi> in any Author of the <hi>Ninth</hi> Age, you could not from thence infer, that they were all ſilent in this caſe. For before the Invention of <hi>Printing,</hi> the <hi>Monks</hi> left no means uneſſay'd to ſuppreſs all that ſeem'd contrary to their Intereſt; and ſeveral other Accidents have occaſion'd the loſs of a great number of good Books.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, we have no reaſon to wonder that a Hiſtory of this Nature was kept very ſecret: ſince <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Shame</hi> were Motives ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to impoſe ſilence on the Writers of that Age.

                     <p>After all, I cannot conceive what ſhould make the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo unwilling to own her <hi>She Pope,</hi> as if <hi>Monſtruous Popes</hi> were Rarities. I am ſure Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> makes no ſcruple to beſtow that Title on a great number of 'em. And as for <hi>Vacancies,</hi> there have been ſome that have laſted longer than the whole time of her Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate: You know there was an <hi>Interregnum</hi> of almoſt nine Years between <hi>Nicholas</hi> the I. and <hi>Adrian</hi> the II. Nor can they want a remedy for the Nullity of Adminiſtration; for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> have Salves for all Sores.</p>

                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:45740:266"/>But, all things being duly conſider'd, I would willingly know, what it is in this Adventure that appears ſo ſtrange and ſurprizing. Is there any Contradiction or Prodigy in it, or even any thing that is rare and wonderful? As for me, I aſſure you, I can perceive nothing but what is very natural and eaſy. If, as I intimated before, inſtead of an innocent <hi>Agnes,</hi> you ſuppoſe a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whoſe Manners, Capacity, Humour and outward Behaviour repreſent a Man; I cannot imagin upon what grounds you can raiſe the leaſt ſhadow of an Objection.</p>

                     <p>Near adjoyning to that Building is the Lodge call'd <hi>Sancta Scala,</hi> from the 28 <hi>Steps</hi> that were tranſported thither. They are of white Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, very much worn; and they pretend that theſe are the Steps by which Chriſt aſcended to <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Houſe.

The Chapel at the top of the Stairs is call'd <hi>Sancta Sanctorum,</hi> or the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> from an <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which, they believe, was made by Angels, and is religiouſly preſerv'd there. I have ſeen this Piece, and can aſſure you, it is very ugly and ill ſhap'd. Women never enter into this <hi>moſt Holy</hi> place.</p>

                        </note>But to change the Subject of my Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that their Variety at leaſt may pleaſe you, I ſhall in the next place give you ſome account of our Voyage to <hi>Caſtel-Gandolfo.</hi> This Houſe has nothing remarkable in it, tho' it belongs to the Pope. Cardinal <hi>H</hi>— has an Apartment in it; and ſometimes goes to paſs a few days there, where he may be free from the Encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of the Ceremonies of <hi>Rome,</hi> than which nothing can be more troubleſome to a Cardinal.</p>
                     <p>During our ſhort ſtay at this place, we took ſeveral turns into the adjacent Country: About a mile from the Caſtle we viſited the little Town of <hi>Albano,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">ALBANO.</note> where the famous City of <hi>Alba</hi> was formerly ſeated, extending, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the common Belief, from the brink of the Lake of <hi>Caſtle Gandolfo</hi> to the new Town of <hi>Albano;</hi> but this Opinion is controverted, and I will not undertake to decide the Queſtion.</p>
                     <p>We ſaw at <hi>Albano</hi> a kind of Tower or ruin'd <hi>Mauſoleum,</hi> commonly call'd the <hi>Tomb of Aſcanius;</hi> but this Opinion ſeems only to be grounded on a very uncertain Tradition.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>I</hi> may ſpeak more poſitively of another ancient Tomb near <hi>Albano,</hi> which is generally believ'd to be the Sepulchre of the <hi>Two Horatii,</hi>
                        <pb n="89" facs="tcp:45740:269"/>
and the <hi>Three Curiatii.</hi> 'Tis plain, that the <hi>Five Pyramids</hi> which are on the Tomb have given occaſion to this Opinion; but this Reaſon is of no force, for <hi>Titus Livius</hi> expreſly affirms, That the Sepulchres of theſe <hi>Heroes</hi> were erected in the ſame places where each of 'em expir'd; thoſe of the <hi>Horatii</hi> towards <hi>Alba,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Curiatii</hi> nearer <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lake</hi> of <hi>Caſtel Gandolfo</hi> is, as we were inform'd, ſix or ſeven miles in compaſs; and the riſing Grounds which environ it form an exact <hi>Amphitheater.</hi> There are two parts where the depth of the Lake cannot be ſounded; but, which is more wonderful, its Waters do from time to time ſuddenly ſwell, and riſe to the very top of the Banks, which doubtleſs proceeds from its communication with ſubterraneous Gulfs, that diſgorge themſelves into it.</p>
                     <p>Half a mile from thence, near <hi>Genſana,</hi> we ſaw another little <hi>Lake,</hi> call'd by the Moderns <hi>Lago di Nemi,</hi> and by the Ancients <hi>Speculum Dianae,</hi> from a Grove and Temple conſecrated to that <hi>Goddeſs,</hi> which were formerly on the Bank of this Lake.</p>
                     <p>Between <hi>Albano</hi> and <hi>Caſtel-Gandolfo,</hi> we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the Ruins of an <hi>Amphitheater,</hi> and were ſurpriz'd to behold certain great Trees among 'em, that had formerly taken root, and, in a wonderful manner, wrought a paſſage for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves between the beſt cemented Stones and Bricks, which they have cleft aſunder, and pierc'd the Walls, where they are grown great in ſpite of all oppoſition.</p>

                     <p>I will not inſiſt upon the Architecture of theſe <hi>Palaces,</hi> for I'm perſwaded I cannot inform you of any thing of that nature, with which you are not already acquainted. I think I told you before, that 'tis much more uſual in this place to cover the Houſes with ridg'd than flat Roofs, tho' people generally differ much in their Opinions concerning theſe two ways of building. Thoſe ſharp-pointed Roofs that are almoſt equal in heighth to the Body of the Edifice, are in ſome meaſure contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by deſtroying the ſymmetry and decent proportion that ought to be between the whole, or at leaſt the main body, and the other leſs remarkable parts of a Building. But, ſince you are deſirous to know my Opinion, I muſt
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45740:272"/>
tell you, that I prefer the middle way found out by our famous <hi>Manſard</hi> before your flat Roofs.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, you muſt give me leave to entreat you to lay aſide that partial Opinion you ſeem to have of the <hi>Roman Architecture</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. It muſt be acknowledg'd, that there are in this place very beautiful Structures, both ancient and modern, but you muſt not imagine that every thing is in perfection; for here, as well as in other places, there are certain modes of Building peculiar to the Age and Country, and not at all conformable either to the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity or Magnificence of Architecture.</p>
                     <p>I thank you for your excellent Remarks on thoſe admirable <hi>Egyptian Obelisks,</hi> which are at preſent to be ſeen in this City, and ought, in my Opinion, to be reckon'd among its nobleſt Ornaments. I have learn'd many cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things from what you have written on this ſubject, and therefore am oblig'd in Juſtice to anſwer the Queſtions you propoſe, and at the ſame time to give the beſt ſolution I can of ſome of your Doubts concerning thoſe rare Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents.</p>
                     <p>All the <hi>Obelisks</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> are quadrangular, and end in a ſharp point. They reſembl'd the Rays of the <hi>Sun,</hi> that great <hi>Divinity</hi> ador'd by the <hi>Egyptians</hi> under the name of <hi>Oſiris,</hi> and eſteem'd by 'em to be the Habitation of <hi>Beings, Genius's,</hi> and the <hi>Souls of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe.</hi> Their Angles reſpected the four Corners of the World, and denoted the four Elements.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:45740:272"/>The <hi>Hieroglyphic</hi> Characters on theſe Obelisks have been ſuppos'd by ſome to contain the Elogies of ſome <hi>Princes,</hi> or Hiſtories of certain memorable Tranſactions; and they believe that theſe Monuments were erected by the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> both to ſerve for Ornaments, and to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Heroes of their Nation: but thoſe who have penetrated furtheſt into theſe Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, have, in my opinion, demonſtrated clearly, that theſe were open Books, which expos'd to the Eyes of the publick the Secrets of their <hi>Divinity, Aſtrology, Metaphyſics, Magic,</hi> and all the other Sciences that were cultivated by the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> 'Tis certain, that the Vulgar was not capable of unriddling the Myſteries of theſe <hi>Oracles;</hi> but then, as well as now, the unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of Mankind amus'd themſelves with <hi>Shadows</hi> and <hi>Obſcurities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All theſe <hi>Obelisks</hi> are of <hi>Granite,</hi> which is a kind of very hard and laſting Marble, and able, as they aſſur'd us, to reſiſt the Fire for a conſiderable time.<note place="margin">There is not one of 'em that was made at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </note> Without doubt the ſolidity of the Matter was one of the Reaſons that recommended it to their choice.

                     <p>YEſterday, upon a ſecond peruſal of your Letter, I obſerv'd a marginal Note that I had not taken notice of before, in which you deſire me to conſider what Mr. <hi>Chevreau</hi> has written concerning Pope <hi>Joan,</hi> in the ſecond part of his <hi>Hiſtory of the World,</hi> and to give you an account of my Thoughts of his Arguments againſt that Story, which makes me conclude that you have a good opinion of 'em. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>Sir,</hi> I am ready to obey you; for I have read Mr, <hi>Chevreau</hi>'s <hi>Book,</hi> and have made ſome Reflexions on that paſſage in it.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place he acknowledges, that <hi>a conſiderable number of famous Authors have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd that Story, and poſitively aſſerted the Truth of it.</hi> Now, according to the known Rules of Juſtice and Reaſon, this conceſſion alone is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to decide the Controverſie; for when ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Witneſſes of unqueſtion'd credit do una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly atteſt a Matter of Fact, we are oblig'd to believe their Teſtimony, if the thing be poſſible, and we have no Evidence to the contrary, more eſpecially if theſe Witneſſes ſpeak againſt their own Intereſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſe Authorities,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Chevreau, have made a strong impreſſion on credulous Minds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the more judicious and cautious part of Mankind, relying on
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:45740:273"/>
the Silence of ſeveral other Authors, have examin'd and rejected this Fable.</hi> This is certainly a very ſtrange and ſurprizing Maxim, <hi>Seventy</hi> or <hi>Eighty Men,</hi> who cannot with the leaſt appearance of Juſtice be ſuſpected of a Deſign to cheat the World, who were all of the <hi>Roman Religion,</hi> almoſt all <hi>Clergy men,</hi> and even ſome of 'em <hi>Canoniz'd Saints;</hi> all theſe Authors, I ſay,<note n="*" place="margin">This is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd by the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.</hi>
                        </note> do poſitively affirm, That there was a <hi>Female Pope.</hi> Other Authors make no mention of her; and the Silence of theſe muſt invalidate the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the former. May we not probably ſuppoſe, that<note n="†" place="margin">That Pope was made a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal at the age of fourteen years. It is agreed by all Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that he was an impious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> 
                        <hi>Leo</hi> X. reaſon'd after the ſame manner, when he call'd the Goſpel <hi>The Fable of Chriſt.</hi> Some Authors bear witneſs to the Hiſtory of our Saviour; others who liv'd at the ſame time do not mention it, and that <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and cautious Pope relying on the Silence of ſo many Writers, examin'd and rejected the Story.</hi> I will not loſe time to demonſtrate the weakneſs of this way of reaſoning, it deſtroys it ſelf, and does not merit a ſerious confutation.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Chevreau</hi> aſſures us, that <hi>Anaſtaſius the Bibliothecary makes no mention of our Popeſs;</hi> which is alſo the great and boaſted Argument of <hi>Onu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrius,</hi> but they are both miſtaken; you may conſult Mr. <hi>le Sueur</hi>'s <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory,</hi> and <hi>Colomeſius</hi>'s <hi>Hiſtorical Miſcellanies,</hi> where you will find an <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> King's Library, containing an exact account of the <hi>Female Pope;</hi> beſides two other Copies of<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>In the next place I ſhall proceed to conſider Mr. <hi>Chevreau</hi>'s Reflexions on<note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>M. Polonus</hi> flouriſh'd in the middle of the Thirteenth Age.</note> 
                        <hi>Martinus Polonus,</hi> or the <hi>Polander,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Coſenza,</hi> and <hi>Penitentiary</hi> to<note n="‖" place="margin">Some Authors write, That he diſcharg'd the ſame Office un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Nicholas III.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Innocent</hi> IV. M. <hi>Chevreau</hi> calls him a ſilly Monk, and alledges three or four poor Reaſons to prove his Simplicity. <hi>Since that Monk,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in his Treatiſe of the Wonders of</hi> Rome, <hi>miſtakes the Gate of</hi> Oſtia, <hi>or of St.</hi> Paul, <hi>and of</hi> Capena, <hi>and St.</hi> Sebaſtian, <hi>for another which he calls</hi> Collina, <hi>inſtead (as we may probably ſuppoſe) of</hi> Collatina <hi>or</hi> Pinciana, <hi>the</hi> Pantheon <hi>for a Temple of</hi> Cybele, <hi>and the</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheater <hi>for a Temple of the</hi> Sun, <hi>we may the more eaſily forgive that Blunder in his Hiſtory, where he miſtakes a</hi> Pope <hi>for a</hi> Popeſs. In anſwer to theſe Reflexions, I ſay in the general, That tho' <hi>M. Polonus</hi> were really guilty of ſome Errors in giving an account of things of little impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or in explaining ſome hard and obſcure Queſtions, we could not from thence infer, that he had given us a falſe Relation of the <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Pontiff. He took one</hi> Gate <hi>for another, and therefore he took a</hi> Pope <hi>for a</hi> Popeſs, is rather a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45740:274"/>
                        <hi>Jeſt</hi> than an <hi>Argument;</hi> or, if it muſt paſs for an Argument, it may be eaſily retorted upon its Author; for, I may with equal reaſon affirm, that if Mr. <hi>Chevreau</hi>'s Reflexions on <hi>M. Polonus</hi> be falſe and groundleſs, therefore all his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt the Story that is the ſubject of our Controverſie are meer Sophiſms, and he mistakes a <hi>Popeſs</hi> for a <hi>Pope.</hi> That the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is certainly true, will appear from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Conſiderations.</p>
                     <p>(1.) 'Tis plain, that Mr. <hi>Chevreau</hi> knew not that there was a <hi>Gate</hi> call'd <hi>Collina,</hi> when he wrote, That <hi>Polonus takes the Gate of</hi> Oſtia, <hi>and the Gate</hi> Capena <hi>for another which he call'd</hi> Collina<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>inſtead of</hi> Collatina <hi>or</hi> Pinciana. But 'tis certain that <hi>Collina</hi> was the name of a Gate as well as <hi>Collatina;</hi> it took its name <hi>à Colle Quirinali,</hi> and is mention'd by <hi>Ovid;</hi>
                        <q>

This Gate is now call'd <hi>Salara.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(2.) The Gate <hi>Collatina,</hi> ſo call'd from the Town of <hi>Collatium,</hi> is different from the <hi>Pinciana,</hi> as <hi>F. Nardin</hi> has clearly demonſtrated.</p>
                     <p>(3.) Mr. <hi>Chevreau</hi> had no reaſon to find fault with <hi>Martinus Polonus,</hi> for calling the <hi>Pantheon</hi> a Temple of <hi>Cybele,</hi> ſince ſeveral learned Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries are of the ſame opinion.

But there are many who believe that it was ſo call'd becauſe it was conſecrated by <hi>Agrippa</hi> to <hi>Jupiter</hi>

                     <p>(4) Mr. <hi>Chevreau</hi> is not eaſily to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, when he talks of the <hi>Roman Amphitheater,</hi> for there were ſeveral <hi>Amphitheaters</hi> in that City, and the Ruins of ſome of 'em are ſtill remaining. I ſuppoſe he meant the great Amphitheater call'd <hi>Colliſeum,</hi> which was built by <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> and dedicated by <hi>Titus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(5.) I confeſs I have not read <hi>Polonus</hi>'s Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe concerning <hi>Rome,</hi> but 'tis very improbable that he took the <hi>Colliſeum</hi> for a Temple. This is certainly too great an Abſurdity to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, and I vehemently ſuſpect that ſome of his Expreſſions are miſunderſtood. He might indeed ſpeak of a <hi>Temple of the Sun</hi> near that <hi>Amphitheater,</hi> but he could not poſſibly imagin, that the <hi>Colliſeum</hi> was its ſelf a <hi>Temple.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I muſt further tell you, that what you relate concerning a <hi>Manuſcript Polonus</hi> which you have ſeen, where this Story is written on the margin, and by another Hand, does not at all reach the bottom of our Controverſie. You may eaſily conceive that ſome intereſs'd Perſon having geld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Author, that Defect was afterwards ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45740:275"/>
by a more equitable Hand: And thus your <hi>Manuſcript</hi> is only a particular Inſtance, from which nothing can be concluded againſt the Credit of other Copies. If ſome perſon ſhould think fit to reſtore the Hiſtory of our <hi>Popeſs,</hi> by way of a marginal Note, in the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated Copies of <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> this could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Authority of thoſe Originals where the ſame Relation is to be found in the Text. Thus we may reaſonably ſuppoſe, that the Story of Pope <hi>Joan</hi> was left out in your Manuſcript, and afterwards reſtor'd by another Hand: And even <hi>Bellarmin</hi> confeſſes, that <hi>Martinus Polonus</hi> wrote the Hiſtory of our <hi>Popeſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to return to Mr. <hi>Chevreau.</hi> You may obſerve how much he was puzzl'd to give ſome probable account of the firſt occaſion of that Controverſie, ſince he is forc'd to have recourſe to the Opinion, or rather Evaſion, of <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> tho' he conceals the Name of the Author. He pretends that Pope <hi>John</hi> the Twelfth had a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine call'd <hi>Joan,</hi> who was his Favourite, and govern'd him ſo abſolutely, that he was uſually nick-nam'd <hi>Joan.</hi> Beſides, he goes further than <hi>Onuphrius;</hi> for whereas that Author ſpeaks only conjecturally, Mr. <hi>Chevreau</hi> aſſerts poſitively, <hi>That</hi> John <hi>the Twelfth was call'd</hi> Pope Joan, <hi>becauſe of the blind Complaiſance that he had for his Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine. Onuphrius</hi>'s Conjectures are meer airy No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and groundleſs Suſpicions: and Mr. <hi>Chev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reau</hi>'s Aſſertion is raſh and precarious; he can produce no other Argument to prove, that <hi>John</hi> the Twelfth was call'd <hi>Pope Joan,</hi> but his own bare Authority; and neither <hi>Onuphrius</hi> nor he
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45740:276"/>
can make it appear, that<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Platina</hi> calls him the moſt pernicious and infamous of all the Popes that preceeded him. Some Writers relate, adds that Author, That he was ſlain in the act of Adultery.</note> ever <hi>Pope John</hi> had ſuch a Concubine. 'Tis true, they both cite <hi>Luitprand</hi> to confirm their Hypotheſis, but they cite him falſly. The Name of the Widow men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by Mr. <hi>Chevreau</hi> was <hi>Ann,</hi> not <hi>Joan;</hi> and without doubt he was ignorant that our illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous<note n="†" place="margin">

Beſides, it may be obſerv'd, that this Pope <hi>John</hi> was advanc'd to the Papal Chair a hundred years after Pope <hi>Joan,</hi> which is another Abſurdity that attends Mr. <hi>Chevreau</hi>'s Opinion.</p>
                     <p>He adds, That <hi>the Story of the pretended bor'd Chair is not better grounded, and that the Chair is not bor'd.</hi> But, by his leave, I have ſeen it more than once, and if I may believe my own Eyes, it is bor'd, and that after the uſual manner of Cloſe ſtools.

                     <p>To proceed to Mr. <hi>Chevreau</hi>'s laſt Argument, he tells us, That <hi>the Fathers of the Council of</hi> Soiſſons <hi>having written to Pope</hi> Leo <hi>the Fourth, to deſire his Approbation, their Deputies found that he was deceas'd before their arrival, and return'd the ſame year from</hi> Rome <hi>to</hi> France, <hi>with the Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of his Succeſſor</hi> Benedict <hi>III.</hi> You have ſeen with how little certainty this Author has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded hitherto; and his End is ſuitable to his Beginning, He mentions a<note n="*" place="margin">It was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Council or Conventicle held at that place, which <hi>Nicholas</hi> the First would never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</note> Council of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> without any other Mark of Diſtinction: He tells us a Story without the leaſt proof, and, which is worſe, he cannot prove it; for we muſt not rely upon the Teſtimonies of <hi>Sirmond</hi> and <hi>Binius,</hi> or on the Authority of the late Editions of the Councils. To prove his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially in ſuch a doubtful Caſe as this, he ought to produce <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> of <hi>uncontroverted</hi> Antiquity and Credit; but we muſt excuſe him, ſince his Story is not to be found in ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Originals. If he could certainly fix the time of the departure of that Council's Envoys to Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and of their return after his death, the duration of his Pontificate might be alſo determin'd, which none of all thoſe who deny the Story of Pope <hi>Joan</hi> have hitherto been able to do. This is an important Remark, and deſerves to be conſider'd with attention. <hi>Onu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrius,</hi> and the reſt of his Party, are forc'd to lengthen the Lives of the Popes that preceeded
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:45740:278"/>
and follow'd our Popeſs, and by confounding the order of their ſucceſſion, have thrown themſelves into inextricable Labyrinths. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> one of the moſt ſubtle and dextrous of all theſe Chronologers, in his Treatiſe of <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Writers,</hi> extends the time of <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Firſt's Pontificate to<note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Platina</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes Seven years, Nine months, and Thirteen days.</note> Ten years, which in his <hi>Chronology</hi> he reduces to Nine years and a half. Examine all theſe Authors, and you ſhall not find one who does not contradict himſelf, ſo difficult a Task it is to counterfeit the Truth. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> has not forgot to calculate the time of the Pontificate of any one Pope, but only of <hi>Leo</hi> IV, which is a ſhrewd ſign that he was ſtrangely puzzl'd how to diſpoſe of the Two years during which the Papal Throne was fill'd by <hi>Joan, aliàs John</hi> VIII. But this is not the only Inconvenience with which his Opinion is clogg'd; for he and his Companions, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punging that Woman out of the Catalogue of Popes, have entangl'd themſelves in new Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. And whereas they who make Truth the Standard of their Relations reckon four and twenty Popes that bore the Name of <hi>John,</hi> the reſt count only twenty three, and by ſo doing confound the whole Hiſtory. Thus their <hi>John the Twelfth,</hi> whom we mention'd before, is <hi>John the Thirteenth,</hi> according to <hi>Platina,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>I have nothing more to add concerning Mr. <hi>Chevreau,</hi> for I will not trouble you with an account of all the Faults that I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in his Hiſtory. And indeed, it is no great wonder that he was not able to carry on ſo vaſt
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:45740:278"/>
and general a Work without falling into ſome Errors.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall only ſubjoin three or four ſhort Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks for a further illuſtration of our preſent Controverſie.</p>
                     <p>You muſt not be ſurpriz'd to find our <hi>Popeſs</hi> call'd both <hi>Anglicus</hi> and <hi>Moguntinus,</hi> as if that were a plain Contradiction; the<note n="*" place="margin">Werner Rool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winck <hi>a</hi> Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalian.</note> Author of <hi>Faſciculus Temporum</hi> has unriddl'd the whole Myſtery in theſe words, <hi>Joannes Anglicus cognomine, ſed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Moguntinus.</hi> Her Name was <hi>Joan Engliſh,</hi> and ſhe was born at <hi>Mentz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Variations that are obſerv'd in <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts</hi> ought not to trouble you. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that this Story is to be found in ſome of 'em, and not in others; but you are not ignorant of the Forgeries of Tranſcribers, or how they were wont to mangle the Books with which they were intruſted. I might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fill a large Volume with Inſtances of their Impoſtures.</p>
                     <p>I ſee no reaſon why it ſhould appear ſtrange that ſome of thoſe who relate this Hiſtory ſeem to ſpeak doubtfully of it; for, beſides that it ſeems at firſt view to be encumber'd with ſome odd and intricate circumſtances; 'tis certain that they could not expreſs much Zeal in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Truth of ſuch a Relation, without expoſing themſelves to viſible Dangers. The Force of Truth prompted and compell'd 'em to ſpeak; and the Fear of giving Offence to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was a Bridle to reſtrain 'em. All this may be eaſily conceiv'd; however, we ſee ſeveral Authors have broken thro' all theſe Difficulties, and have given us ſuch clear and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:45740:279"/>
exact accounts of that Event, that we could not have deſerv'd a more poſitive confirmation of it.</p>
                     <p>Two or three ſuch Teſtimonies as theſe would be ſufficient to convince any reaſonable Perſon of the truth of our Aſſertion. And, what tho' they are contradicted by Hundreds, and by Millions? Truth can never be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd by the numbers of its Enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Hiſtory of the <hi>Popeſs</hi> does not imply the leaſt contradiction; it is atteſted by ſeveral Men of Honour, who were conſtrain'd by the Evidence of Truth to ſpeak againſt the Intereſt of their own Party; our Adverſaries themſelves cannot pretend that it was foiſted into the Writings of theſe Authors by the Enemies of Popery; and it was receiv'd without contradiction during the ſpace of Five hundred years, by the confeſſion of thoſe very perſons who call it a Fable. 'Tis plain then, that all the <hi>Negative Authorities</hi> in the World are not capable of <hi>invalidating</hi> the Credit of ſo many <hi>Authentick Witneſſes,</hi> and of a Relation ſo ſolidly and generally atteſted.</p>
                     <p>I have already given you an account of my Thoughts, in anſwer to that part of your Letter where you mention ſome of our Doctors, who deny the Story of <hi>Pope Joan;</hi> but ſince I perceive you inſiſt on this Argument, I muſt tell you plainly, that it is a very unwarrantable piece of Partiality, not to give it a worſe name, blindly to embrace the Opinions of any Man not divinely inſpir'd, whatever figure he may make in the World. A Man of Sence will never ſuffer his Judgment to be byaſs'd either by the Voice of the Publick, or by the Numbers

or pretended Authority of Writers that are dignified by great Titles. Three quarters of the Chriſtian World are meer Slaves to thoſe ancient Writers whom they call <hi>The Fathers;</hi> tho', 'tis certain, the good Inſtructions they have left us are mix'd with a great number of dangerous, falſe, inſipid, and ridiculous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
                     <p>I thought to have ended our Controverſie here, but I believe it will not be improper to remove another Difficulty before I leave this Subject. I muſt confeſs, I was ſomewhat ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd to find that, inſtead of Mr. <hi>Chevreau,</hi> you had conjur'd up againſt me ſo terrible an Adverſary as the famous<note n="*" place="margin">David Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del.</note> 
                        <hi>Blondel,</hi> who is the Pillar and Bulwark of <hi>Antipopeſſiſm,</hi> and whoſe bare Name has gain'd abundance of Proſelytes to his Opinions. He was a man of Learning and Wit; beſides, he was a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and conſequently was believ'd to have no other Intereſt than that of Truth in the Succeſs of the Quarrel which he had eſpous'd. 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, his Authority has been always a Stone of Stumbling to thoſe who are wont to make Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice their Rule of Faith. The Name of the Author is the ſtrongeſt Argument in his Book, and it is that alone which has given the greateſt Blow to his Enemies.</p>
                     <p>I have read this Piece over and over with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and can aſſure you it is written after a manner very proper to blind the Eyes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Judgments of the generality of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. But thoſe who will not ſuffer themſelves to be impos'd upon, and ſtill look for ſomething that is ſolid and material, will not find any
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:45740:281"/>
thing in the whole Book worthy of that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
                     <p>I could fill a Volume with Obſervations and Criticiſms on this Work, for I have made ſome Reflexions on every Page, and perhaps every Period in it. This is not a proper place for 'em; but I may find an opportunity hereafter to communicate 'em to you; in the mean time I ſhall content my ſelf with giving you a general Idea of it, accompanied with a few particular Remarks, according to the method by which I have anatomiz'd it.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Blondel</hi> begins with a Declaration that gives a wound to his Cauſe, which all his Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices can never palliate. The Force of Truth and of authentick Teſtimonies, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from<note n="*" place="margin">He means <hi>Salmaſius.</hi>
                        </note> thoſe to whom he neither would nor durſt refuſe to give credit, extorted this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Confeſſion from him, That <hi>the Hiſtory of the Female Pope is contain'd in the</hi> Augsburg <hi>Copies of</hi> Anaſtaſius; which I mention'd before. You ſee what Advantage he has given to his Enemies; and, what Stratagem d' ye think he uſes to recover his Ground? Could you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that a man of his parts would have recourſe to the pooreſt Evaſion that ever baffl'd Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was guilty of? or, that he would ſtart an imaginary Difficulty, that he might afterwards the more eaſily grapple with this Wind-mill in his own Brain? He is ſenſible there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but dry Blows to be got by meddling with theſe original Manuſcripts, and that they would be too hard for all his Rhetoric, and therefore he e'en very fairly leaves 'em as he found 'em, without ever mentioning 'em after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:45740:281"/>
and finds out another <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> written about Two hundred years ago, which contains alſo the ſame Hiſtory, but accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with ſome circumſtances which, he aſſures us, imply ſeveral Contradictions. And, <hi>It ſeems,</hi> adds he, <hi>that the</hi> Pariſian Anaſtaſius <hi>ſhould give light to thoſe of</hi> Augsburg. At firſt he dares not advance ſuch a Paradox, but with an <hi>it ſeems,</hi> and without conſidering whether that which <hi>ſeems</hi> to him does alſo <hi>ſeem</hi> ſo to others; he builds his Diſcourſe on this uncertain Foundation, and at the ſame time, tho' tacitely, eſtabliſhes his Suppoſition for a certain Truth. Thus, with his <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> of Two hundred years, he has found the Secret to confute all the other Copies of that Author, without citing one of 'em.</p>
                     <p>But, what is ſtill worſe, his <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> is a private Piece, which he ſhews only by Shreds, and dares not produce. If I were not reſtrain'd by fear of injuring Mr. <hi>Blondel</hi>'s Sincerity, I ſhould be ſtrongly tempted to ſuſpect that his <hi>Manuſcript</hi> was never ſeen by any Man but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: and at leaſt I think I may be allow'd to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he durſt not quote the whole paſſage, leſt it might furniſh his Adverſaries with Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons againſt himſelf.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place then, we muſt believe Mr. <hi>Blondel</hi> upon his own ſingle Teſtimony, that there was really ſuch an <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> and ſuch a Paſſage in it, as he cites; but his Manuſcript might have been ſuppoſititious, or at leaſt a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern and even, by his own confeſſion, an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Copy, ſince he tells us it had been often taken for a <hi>Platina.</hi> 'Tis ſtrange, that any man
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:45740:282"/>
that can read ſhould not be able to diſtinguiſh <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> from <hi>Platina.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, After we have blindly believ'd all that this Author is pleas'd to tell us concerning his pretended <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> we muſt extend our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance further, and, upon the credit of his bare <hi>it ſeems,</hi> either believe or ſuppoſe his tacite Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that this <hi>Manuſcript</hi> not only may ſerve to illuſtrate the <hi>Anaſtaſius's</hi> of <hi>Augsburg,</hi> as he pretends at firſt, but is a true Copy of theſe, and even of the moſt ancient and exact <hi>Anaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius's;</hi> for, if this ſuppoſition be falſe, all his Arguments muſt fall to the Ground.</p>
                     <p>I may venture to affirm, that this Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration alone is ſufficient to diſcredit Mr. <hi>Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi>'s famous Book, the main deſign of which ſhould have been to deſtroy and confute, by clear and ſolid Reaſons, the poſitive Teſtimony of ſuch a learn'd and unintereſs'd <hi>Eye-witneſs</hi> as <hi>Anaſtaſius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before I proceed to communicate to you ſome other Remarks on Mr. <hi>Blondel</hi>'s Treatiſe, I muſt deſire you not to expect to find 'em all accompanied with Demonſtrations; I may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, for brevity's ſake, omit the Proofs of ſome of my Aſſertions, but I ſhall be ready to ſupply that Defect when you pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>In the general 'tis certain, that <hi>this Book may be entirely and unanſwerably confuted out of it ſelf;</hi> and that <hi>far from deſtroying the Hiſtory of the Popeſs, the Truth of that Event may be ſolidly demonſtrated by Reaſons drawn from this very Treatiſe.</hi> Theſe are two Poſitions which I dare confidently aſſert, and undertake to maintain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:45740:282"/>Among all the Contradictions with which this Diſcourſe is ſtuff'd, I ſhall only deſire you to obſerve, that two thirds of it are ſpent in litigious <hi>Chronological</hi> Cavils, and vain Rhodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montadoes againſt the Authors of our Hiſtory. After which he forgets himſelf ſo far,<note place="margin">Above all, the Chronology of the Biſhops or Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> is a dreadful Labyrinth.</note> as to make a long Harangue to demonſtrate the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of <hi>Chronology,</hi> and the weakneſs of thoſe Arguments that are drawn from it, either to confirm or invalidate the Truth of a Relation. When he finds that <hi>Chronology</hi> may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to his Hypotheſis, he flies at it greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and triumphs as in the Teſtimony of an Oracle; but every thing that looks a skew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Calculation, is a Trifle or Miſtake.</p>
                     <p>There is a certain Air of Oſtentation ſpread over all his Book, which makes him on all occaſions leave the ſubject of his Diſcourſe, that he may at any rate make a vain Show of his Reading. And even, not unfrequently, this itching Deſire to ſhow his Learning makes him utter things extreamly diſadvantageous to the Intereſt of his Opinion; but he muſt diſplay all that he knows, whatſoever it may coſt him.</p>
                     <p>He heaps up a multitude of needleſs and impertinent Quotations, not only to ſatisfie his Vanity, but alſo to confound his Readers, and to ſtun 'em with a multitude of noiſie Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities? 'Tis plain, that he endeavours to weary People, and to bar the acceſs to his Book with heaps of uſeleſs Digreſſions and empty Cavils, which ſerve only to encreaſe the Obſcurity and Intricacy of the controverted Queſtion. He very ſeldom purſues his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:45740:283"/>
cloſely, and oftentimes picks up ſome tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial Story which Chance throws in his way, and makes as great a noiſe with it, as if it were tne main Point for which he contends. He triumphs out of ſeaſon, and confutes petty Circumſtances with a great deal of Solemnity, to amuſe his Readers. He exaggerates Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and when he meets with one that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes him, ſplits it perhaps into half a ſcore. He fills his Refutations with ſcurrilous and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reflexions. He commonly gives the Lye to his Adverſaries, and upbraids 'em with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures and Blunders, that he may inſenſibly accuſtom thoſe that will ſuffer themſelves to be influenc'd by ſo bad an Example, to rail per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually againſt the Aſſerters of the oppoſite Opinion. His Jeſts are alſo too ſpiteful and biting, and he lays about him on all hands without Mercy. This Peeviſhneſs and ill Humour is an evident ſign that he was non-pluſs'd; and ſometimes he viſibly bewrays a great deal of Fear and Heſitancy in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of his Attacks: Neither is he very ſollicitous to be underſtood, if he can but hoodwink his Readers, and draw 'em after him into the Labyrinth in which he has engag'd himſelf.</p>
                     <p>'Tis certainly very pleaſant to obſerve how theſe doughty Critics, after they have exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Wit in Reflexions on the Hiſtory of our <hi>Popeſs,</hi> are puzzl'd to divine the original occaſion of that pretended Fable. Some, with <hi>Baronius,</hi> run as far as <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to find out an Imaginary <hi>Patriarcheſs</hi> of that See, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſidering that by ſo doing they confirm
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45740:283"/>
the probability of <hi>Pope Joan</hi>'s Adventure. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as <hi>Onuphrius</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chevreau,</hi> transform an <hi>Ann</hi> to a <hi>Joan,</hi> as I intimated before, and by a ſecond <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> turn this <hi>Joan</hi> into a <hi>Maud,</hi> or an <hi>Olympia,</hi> who govern'd Pope <hi>John</hi> the Twelfth; and at laſt they ſqueeze a ſort of a Popeſs out of this Concubine, whom, after all, they are forc'd to bury a hundred years before ſhe was born, that they may bring her again upon the Stage in time and place conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. <hi>Allatius</hi> has alſo forg'd a certain <hi>Thiota,</hi> a pretended Propheteſs of <hi>Mentz,</hi> whom he transfigures as dexterouſly as he can into a <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Pontife.</hi> Mr. <hi>Blondel</hi> relates ſeveral other Conjectures, and confutes 'em all; he is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully modeſt on this occaſion, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that this is a Myſtery which he is not able to unriddle. But this is not the only place where he diſplays his Candour; for he imploys fourteen or fifteen Pages of his Pamphlet in a Panegyric on Truth and Juſtice; and while the Fit of Generoſity is upon him, he cannot ſuffer thoſe unjuſt Calumniators of the Papal See to eſcape unpuniſh'd; which, he aſſures us, was the only Motive that oblig'd him to draw his Pen. Let us only make two ſhort Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on this Pretence, and then, if you pleaſe, we will proceed to ſome other ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Whether there ever was a <hi>Woman-Pope,</hi> or not, 'tis certain things are otherwiſe in ſuch a poſture, that this Circumſtance ſingly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd can neither be advantageous nor prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the Intereſt of the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> I never could endure to inſult over 'em upon this account, as ſome among us are wont to do,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:45740:284"/>
for I'm perſwaded that 'tis impoſſible to draw any Inferences from this Adventure more to the diſadvantage of that Party, than thoſe that may eaſily be deduc'd from the Stories of ſeveral <hi>Popes</hi> who were far worſe than our <hi>Popeſs.</hi> If, excepting only this Creature, all the reſt of the Popes had been Men of Probity, good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and vigilant and faithful Paſtors; had their Lives and Morals been unblemiſh'd, and their Doctrine pure and uncorrupted, I ſhould not be ſurpriz'd that thoſe of that Profeſſion could not bear ſo ſcandalous a Reproach. But ſince the moſt bigotted Authors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion acknowledge that there has been a prodigious number of abominable Popes, why ſhould our <hi>She-Pontife</hi> be eſteem'd a more hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Monſter than the reſt, meerly becauſe ſhe was of another Sex? The <hi>Church of Rome</hi> then ought not to make ſuch a terrible pother about an affair of ſo little conſequence: and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mr. <hi>Blondel</hi> had much leſs reaſon to take Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the Noſe on the ſame occaſion: his Zeal is at beſt but impertinent, and his Charity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. Such an inſignificant <hi>Remedy</hi> as that which he adminiſters can never <hi>purifie</hi> the whole <hi>Maſs</hi> of the <hi>Papal Blood,</hi> which, by the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous confeſſion of Hiſtorians of all Religions, is extreamly <hi>foul</hi> and <hi>corrupted.</hi> And it muſt be acknowledg'd, that Mr. <hi>Blondel</hi>'s Harangue on thoſe Principles of Generoſity that prompted him to undertake this Work, is too tedious and full of Affectation, to perſwade a judicious and unbyaſs'd Reader of the Author's Sincerity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:45740:284"/>But I muſt at laſt conclude this Subject, by telling you all I think, and even all that I know of my Adverſary. And, to ſpeak freely on this occaſion, I may venture to aſſure you, he was acted by Intereſt as well as by Oſtentation. A Man of Honour who liv'd at <hi>Paris,</hi> and knew that Writer particularly, inform'd me, that he learn'd from the firſt hand that he was <hi>hir'd</hi> to write a Treatiſe againſt the Story of <hi>Pope Joan.</hi> My Author is in all reſpects worthy of Credit; nor is Mr. <hi>Blondel</hi> the only Man in the World who has been perſwaded by <hi>Silver Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi> to act ſuch a part.</p>
                     <p>'Tis not without Reluctancy I mention any thing that may be made uſe of to blacken the Character of a Man, who, to take him in the general, was certainly a Perſon of Merit; and you muſt give me leave to ſay in his juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that perhaps he really believ'd the Story to be doubtful: Beſides that, all things conſider'd, he did a Favour to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> by writing againſt the <hi>Popeſs,</hi> without doing the leaſt Injury to <hi>Ours.</hi> Our Religious Differences do not at all depend on the Truth or Falſhood of that Story; and therefore Mr. <hi>Blondel</hi> might look upon it as a matter of Indifference.</p>
                     <p>I can ſay little or nothing in anſwer to your Queſtions concerning the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> that are in this City. They have each of 'em their particular Ceremonies, and officiate accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their peculiar Rites; but they are forc'd to ſubſcribe to the <hi>Pope's Supremacy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can obtain leave to ſettle at <hi>Rome.</hi> Antiquaries believe, that the little <hi>Armenian</hi>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:45740:285"/>
Church was heretofore one of the Temples of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> enjoy'd ſome meaſure of Liberty, and liv'd ſomewhat eaſily before the Pontificate of <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth; but that Pope was a terrible Enemy to 'em: For whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were permitted to live in any part of the City, he confin'd 'em to one corner of it, whither he order'd 'em to retire at the cloſe of the Evening. He forc'd 'em to ſell their Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſuffer'd 'em only to trade in old Clothes. He commanded 'em, for a mark of diſtinction, to wear yellow Hats, and iſſu'd out an expreſs prohibition, That no Chriſtians ſhould either eat or converſe with 'em. <hi>I</hi> am inform'd, that by a Decree of <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII, they were oblig'd, or at leaſt a certain number of 'em, to hear a Chriſtian Sermon every <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Afternoon, but I have not yet had an opportunity to ſee that Aſſembly. The <hi>Italian Jews,</hi> and particularly thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> as ſome of themſelves aſſur'd me, do ſcrupulouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Law that enjoins 'em to marry at Twenty years of age at fartheſt, under the pain of Ignominy, and being treated as perſons li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Sin. The number of the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> may at preſent amount to between <hi>Six</hi> and <hi>Seven thouſand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When any <hi>Jew,</hi> or other <hi>Infidel,</hi> is willing to embrace the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> the Solemnity of his <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is put off to <hi>Saturday</hi> in the <hi>Holy Week,</hi> unleſs ſome urgent Conſideration require greater haſte. This Ceremony is perform'd in the Church of S. <hi>John de Lateran,</hi> where, they
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:45740:285"/>
believe, <hi>Conſtantine the Great</hi> was baptiz'd. We ſaw ſix <hi>Turks</hi> baptiz'd in this Church; they wore a Cloak of white Damask, and a Lawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, with a Silver Croſs hanging at their Neck. The Cardinal that was to officiate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come with the Canons of that Church, the Ceremony was begun with bleſſing the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; after which the Proſelytes, preſented by their Godfathers, advanc'd, every one in his turn, and declar'd their deſire to be baptiz'd; then they lean'd over the Font, and the Cardinal baptiz'd 'em, and gave 'em their Names, by pouring Water on their Heads out of a large Silver Spoon; afterwards taking Wax Tapers in their Hands, they were confirm'd in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the Baptiſtery, and from thence went to hear Maſs in the ſame Church.</p>
                     <p>We were preſent alſo, the <hi>Thurſday</hi> before, at the Ceremony of <hi>waſhing the Feet of Thirteen Pilgrims,</hi> in one of the Chapels of the <hi>Vatican;</hi> they were likewiſe cloth'd in white, and beſides had a kind of Hood, with a ſquare Cap. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet all in a row upon a Bench, they pull'd off their Shoes and Stockings, and a <hi>Prieſt</hi> came to ſee whether they were ready; afterwards a great Baſon was brought in, and Ewers of Vermilion, one for every Pilgrim: Then the Cardinal that officiated in the <hi>Pope</hi>'s abſence waſh'd their Feet in the Baſon, rubbing 'em with his own Hands, and then wip'd and kiſs'd 'em. After which every Pilgrim receiv'd two Gold Medals, and all in a body went to one of the Chambers in the Palace, where a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Entertainment was prepar'd for 'em: all the Thirteen Pilgrims were plac'd on one ſide of a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45740:286"/>
Table, and the Cardinals ſate at another in the ſame Room.</p>
                     <p>I will not trouble you with a particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the reſt of the Ceremonies that we ſaw during the <hi>Holy Week,</hi> ſince they have been exactly deſcrib'd by others.</p>
                     <p>The<note n="*" place="margin">Innocent <hi>XI.</hi>
                        </note> Pope is really old and infirm; but, 'tis plain, that he makes his want of Health ſerve for a Pretext to excuſe his abſence at all thoſe numerous Ceremonies. I am very credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly inform'd, that he did by no means approve of the <hi>French Dragooning;</hi> and I learn'd from a good hand, that he could not be brought to take notice of thoſe Steps that were lately made by that Crown towards a Reconciliation. The Miniſter that was entruſted with the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Affair could never obtain a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Anſwer to his Propoſals, nor ſo much as a free Audience.</p>
                     <p>The extream Privacy of that Retirement in which this Pontife ſpends his days, not only hides him from the Eyes of Strangers, but they are even hardly able to perceive that he is in Town; for they never meet with any Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queys, Coaches, or Retinue that belong to him: when he goes abroad, which he does very rarely, he is carry'd in a Litter. Theſe Litters are very large, lin'd with crimſon Velvet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and within, with Gold Galoons and Fringes; and the Harneſs of the Mules are adorn'd after the ſame manner. The Pope is always alone in his Litter, in the fore-part of which there is a little Table inſtead of a Seat. All Popes have the ſame Livery, which is ſcarlet, with a double Velvet-Galoon of the ſame colour. Almoſt all
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:45740:286"/>
the Apartments of the <hi>Vatican</hi> and <hi>Monte-Cavallo</hi> are likewiſe hung with red Damask, adorn'd with Bands of Gold-Galoon, and above with Gold-Fringes.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation of the Gardens of <hi>Monte-Cavallo</hi> is very pleaſant, but the contrivance of 'em is irregular, and they appear'd to us to be very much neglected.</p>
                     <p>The two Marble Horſes that ſtand before the Palace were by <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth's Order brought from <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s <hi>Baths.</hi> It is, and has always been, the general Opinion, That one of 'em is the Work of <hi>Phidias,</hi> and the other of <hi>Praxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teles,</hi> the Names of thoſe two famous Sculptors being engraven upon 'em. 'Tis alſo ſaid,<note place="margin">Opus Phidiae, Opus Praxitelis.</note> and many Authors have written, That theſe Horſes are the Statues of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> which theſe Artiſts made in Emulation of one-another, but there muſt certainly be ſome Miſtake in this Tradition. <hi>Phidias</hi> flouriſh'd a whole Age before <hi>Praxiteles,</hi> and <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> liv'd Fifty years after <hi>Praxiteles.</hi> 'Tis plain then, either that theſe Statues are not the Work of the above-mention'd Sculptors, or that they were not made for <hi>Bucephalus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The two other Horſes of Marble, that are to be ſeen in the Court of the <hi>Capitol,</hi> were taken from <hi>Pompey</hi>'s <hi>Theatre;</hi> and the Statue on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back of Braſs which ſtands in the ſame place, was erected there by <hi>Paul</hi> III. 'tis thought to be the Statue of <hi>Marcus Aurelius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Capitol</hi> is a modern Structure, rais'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ruins, and even on part of the<note n="*" place="margin">The old Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations appear.</note> Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the ancient Edifice: it would require a whole Volume to deſcribe all the remarkable

Antiquities in this place; I ſhall only name ſome of the principal. The <hi>She-Wolf</hi> of Braſs, giving ſuck to the <hi>Illuſtrious Twins,</hi> on which may be ſeen the mark of the Thunderbolt mention'd by<note n="*" place="margin">Orat. 3. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Cat.</note> 
                        <hi>Cicero;</hi> the four great <hi>Baſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relievo's,</hi> which repreſent ſeveral Paſſages of the Hiſtory of <hi>Marcus Aurelius;</hi> the <hi>Columna roſtrata</hi> of the General, or Admiral and Conſul <hi>Duillius,</hi> the firſt that was honour'd with a Naval Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in <hi>Rome;</hi> the <hi>Courier</hi> pulling a Thorn out of his Foot after he had deliver'd his accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Meſſage to the Senate, who choſe rather to endure that pain during his Journey, than to retard the public Joy; the Buſt of <hi>Cicero,</hi> with his Vetches; the<note n="†" place="margin">One for Oyl, two for Wine, and the fourth for Grain.</note> four ancient <hi>Meaſures;</hi> the Buſt of <hi>Virgil; Nero</hi>'s Nurſe holding that little Monſter by the Hand; the Goddeſs of <hi>Silence;</hi> the God <hi>Pan;</hi> the three <hi>Furies;</hi> a Statue of <hi>Caeſar</hi> with his <hi>Cuiraſs;</hi> another of <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> thoſe of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux;</hi> the Fragments of the <hi>Coloſſes</hi> of <hi>Apollo, Domitian,</hi> and <hi>Commodus;</hi> the <hi>Lion</hi> devouring a Horſe; and the Trophies which ſome think are <hi>Trajan</hi>'s, tho' others aſcribe 'em to <hi>Marius.</hi>

                     <p>The Pictures in <hi>Freſco</hi> in the great Hall are by the Hand of <hi>Cavalier Joſeph;</hi> I am of opinion that they repreſent the firſt Battel between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Sabins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know not well what account to give you of the Pillar call'd the <hi>Milliarium,</hi> for I'm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that it would not be an eaſie Task to explain the true meaning of it; It is of white Marble,<note place="margin">Primus, Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, Tertius ab Urbe Lapis.</note> eight foot and a half high; the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>I</hi> is mark'd on the top of it, and on the Chapiter a Braſs Globe about two foot in dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter:
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:45740:287"/>
The common Opinion is, That this <hi>Column</hi> is in the <hi>Center</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that from hence they began to compute the diſtances from that City, which were divided into <hi>Miles</hi> by other Pillars that were erected on all the great Roads in <hi>Italy;</hi> but there are two or three Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that deſtroy the probability of this ſuppoſition. The Column in the <hi>Forum Romanum</hi> mention'd by <hi>Suetonius, Tacitus,</hi> and ſome other ancient Authors, was, according to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of it, of Braſs, or Braſs gilt, and the Names of the great Roads were engrav'd upon it, with the computed diſtances of the principal Cities; but no ſuch thing appears on the <hi>Milliarium</hi> in the <hi>Capitol.</hi> You will perhaps tell me, that the brazen Column might be loſt, and the <hi>Milliarium</hi> ſet up in its place; but you do not conſider that this laſt was found adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Appian</hi> Road, as it appears by the<note n="†" place="margin">Columnam <hi>Milliariam</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi ab urbe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidis Indicem, ab Imperatore <hi>Veſpaſiano</hi> &amp; <hi>Nerva</hi> reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam, de Ruinis ſuburbanis <hi>Viae Appiae</hi> in <hi>Capito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium</hi> tranſtulit.</note> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Inſcription engrav'd on one of the Faces of its Pedeſtal: nor is it at all probable that this Pillar was tranſported from the middle of the City to a mile's diſtance from the Walls. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, how is it poſſible to explain the meaning of theſe Expreſſions <hi>Primus,</hi> or <hi>Secundus ab <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbe Lapis,</hi> if theſe <hi>Stones</hi> or Columns were not <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> the City, ſince the word <hi>ab urbe</hi> does evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently imply that they were not <hi>in</hi> it? If I had never heard or read of the gilt <hi>Milliarium</hi> in the heart of the City, where ſome Authors pretend that all the <hi>Conſulary Roads</hi> met, I ſhould have certainly concluded from the words <hi>Ab <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbe, from the City,</hi> that <hi>Primus Lapis,</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> Column, or <hi>Milliarium,</hi> ſuch as that in the <hi>Capitol,</hi> had been erected at the diſtance of <hi>one Mile</hi> from
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:45740:288"/>
the Walls of <hi>Rome.</hi> Since this <hi>Milliarium</hi> was found in one of the Suburbs of the City, and near to one of the Highways, I ſhould have believ'd that its proper place was there, and that the number of thoſe <hi>Firſt Columns</hi> equall'd that of the great Roads. Whether we ſuppoſe that the gilt <hi>Milliarium</hi> was the only <hi>firſt</hi> Pillar, and that the <hi>ſecond</hi> Columns were plac'd at the diſtance of one mile from it, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs ſeems to imply a contradiction; or that the gilt Column in the center of the City was only a Mark from which all the Diſtances were computed, and that the neareſt Columns were call'd firſt <hi>Milliariums,</hi> and diſtinguiſh'd by an Inſcription like that in the <hi>Capitol:</hi> 'tis obvious from either of theſe Suppoſitions, that, conſidering the Greatneſs of <hi>Rome,</hi> none of all theſe firſt or ſecond Columns could be within the City, and conſequently that this Expreſſion <hi>Primo ab <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbe Lapide</hi> was very improper, and even falſe; for the <hi>primus Lapis</hi> muſt have been <hi>in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbe,</hi> and not <hi>ab <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I am confirm'd in this Opinion by another Circumſtance. There is an ancient Inſcription in the Palace call'd <hi>Palaeſtrinum,</hi> which contains the Statues of a College of <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> and of <hi>Health,</hi> to which one <hi>Salvia Marcellina</hi> bequeath'd a Temple, a <hi>Place</hi> or Court, and a Walk, the whole being ſituated on the <hi>Appian Way,</hi> near the Temple of <hi>Mars, Intra Miliarium primum &amp; ſecundum ab <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbe euntibus;</hi> that is, <hi>Between the firſt and ſecond mile as you go from the City.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis the common Opinion of Antiquaries, that there was a Temple of <hi>Mars</hi> without the City, and on the <hi>Via Appia;</hi> and all theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:45740:288"/>
put together, do almoſt fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me, that<note n="*" place="margin">Since the firſt Edition of this Book, I find that <hi>Holſtenius</hi> is of the ſame Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> the gilt <hi>Milliarium</hi> was erected only to mark the place where all the great Roads begun, and to compute the Diſtances of the chief Cities; but that all the <hi>Firſt Columns</hi> were each One Mile diſtant from the Walls of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <p>The Information I receiv'd from thoſe whom I conſulted on this occaſion, was not very material to confirm either of the oppoſite Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; however, I will think of ſome other way to clear my Doubts, and in the mean time you will oblige me, by ſending me an account of your Thoughts on this ſubject.</p>

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:45740:289"/>
the Son of God, and true God himſelf. The Story adds, that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> finding this Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to agree with the <hi>Sibyllin</hi> Propheſies, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately order'd an Altar to be built in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol,</hi> to the honour of the <hi>Hebrew Child</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by the Oracle, calling it <hi>Ara Primogeniti Dei, The Altar of the Firſt-born of God.</hi> The Church call'd <hi>Ara Coeli</hi> is built in the ſame place, ſo that <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s Altar remains ſtill near the Quire.</p>

About ſixty hours after, the poor Gentleman having fortunately ſcratch'd open a paſſage, clamber'd out of the Pit, and, tho' not without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, got to the next Houſe, his Legs being ſcarce able to ſuſtain his pale, weak, ſtarv'd, and ſpent Body, The People of the Houſe where he enter'd, mov'd with Compaſſion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd ſome comfortable Broths for him, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted him ſo effectually, that he quickly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd his Strength.</p>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:45740:291"/>
of 'em remaining. You muſt not fancy thoſe Vaults, I mean every <hi>Catacomb,</hi> if I may be allow'd to uſe that Expreſſion, to be one ſingle Room; for the <hi>Catacombs</hi> of St. <hi>Agnes,</hi> for example, or thoſe of St. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> are Labyrinths of ſubterraneous Lanes, which turn, wind, and croſs one another like the Streets of a City, Such of theſe Caverns as ſeem never to have been made uſe of for Sepulchres, as thoſe of the Gate <hi>Pinciana,</hi> and thoſe others near St. <hi>John</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, are only nam'd <hi>Grottoes,</hi> and the reſt are call'd <hi>Catacombs,</hi> which is a modern Name without any ſignification, for all the various Etymologies that are given of it are meer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Conjectures.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Roman Catacombs</hi> ſpread themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the <hi>Suburbs,</hi> but at <hi>Naples</hi> they are found only under one part of the City. Theſe Caves are dug out of the Rocks, and extend very far on every ſide; each Vault is commonly about fifteen or eighteen foot wide, and the heighth of the Arch amounts to twelve or fifteen feet: on each ſide there are hollow Niches in the Walls, fram'd like Cheſts of all ſizes, plac'd in rows above one another, without any regular Symmetry, where the Bodies were laid without Coffins, and cover'd with flat Stones or large Tyles, cemented with Chalk and Sand, as it appears diſtinctly in ſome places to this very day. Beſides the Niches in the Catacombs of <hi>Naples,</hi> there are ſome Tombs of a reaſonable bigneſs, adorn'd with diverſe Pictures, among which there are many Figures of Heads and half-Bodies, with the Names of the Perſons, <hi>Paulus, Nicolaus, Proculus, &amp;c.</hi> and ſometimes a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:45740:291"/>
                        <hi>hic jacet,</hi> or <hi>hic requieſcit,</hi> is added to the Names.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>Of all the <hi>Catacombs</hi> we view'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> thoſe of St. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> are the greareſt; the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are commonly as high as thoſe of <hi>Naples,</hi> but the Vaults are but about two foot and a half broad. In ſeveral places we ſaw a great number of cover'd Niches in the higher rows. A Prieſt, whom we happen'd one day to meet there, had the Curioſity to open one of 'em, in which we found a <hi>Skeleton</hi> almoſt moulder'd away into whitiſh Aſhes, yet we might perceive
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:45740:292"/>
that the Body had been laid on its Back. The reaſon why theſe <hi>Catacombs</hi> were not made wider, is becauſe the Ground is ſandy, and could not be underpropp'd, whereas thoſe of <hi>Naples</hi> are hewn out of the ſolid Rock.</p>
                     <p>They pretend here, that <hi>theſe Vaults were dug by the Chriſtians; that during the Firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, Divine Service was perform'd in 'em; that theſe burying-places were peculiar to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and never us'd by the Heathens; that a great number of Saints and Martyrs were interr'd in 'em; and conſequently,</hi> which is the Cream of the Story, <hi>that they are inexhauſtible Store-houſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tho' theſe Suppoſitions were true, they could not juſtifie the Practice of thoſe who pick up every Bone they meet with in a <hi>Catacomb,</hi> and meerly becauſe they found it there, conclude that it ought to be rank'd among thoſe things call'd <hi>Relicks.</hi> But this Conſideration would lead me into a Controverſie which I am not willing to examine at this time; neither will I undertake to write a long Diſſertation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt part of the above-mention'd Hypotheſis, which would require more time and Books than I am Maſter of at preſent; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in obedienee to your deſire, I ſhall make a few ſhort Remarks on theſe Propoſitions.</p>
                     <p>Since we are not oblig'd to give credit to the ſingle Teſtimony of any man in his own Cauſe, <hi>'Tis a general Rule that admits of no Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> that every Man that expects to be believ'd muſt prove what he affirms. 'Tis plain then, that they who maintain ſo poſitively, That <hi>the Catacombs were made by Chriſtians for their own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:45740:292"/>
uſe,</hi> ought to demonſtrate the Truth of their Aſſertion. This they have not done, and therefore I might juſtly reject their Opinion without being at the charge of an Argument to confute it. Yet, by way of <hi>ſupererogation,</hi> and out of complaiſance to you, I ſhall ſubjoin ſome Conſiderations which will very much weaken, if not entirely deſtroy, their Hypotheſis.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) The firſt thing that comes into my mind on this occaſion, is a Paſſage which I obſerv'd not long ago in <hi>Horace,</hi> where that Author ſpeaking of the <hi>Puteculi,</hi> or <hi>public Burying-places,</hi> where the poorer ſort of People in <hi>Rome</hi> were uſually interr'd, makes a deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of 'em which agrees exactly with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I have given you of the <hi>Catacombs.</hi>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:45740:293"/>
famous an Antiquary than Mr. <hi>Spon;</hi> for you may obſerve in the Collection of ancient Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions with which he has enrich'd the account of his <hi>Voyage to Greece,</hi> that he could not be perſwaded to believe that the <hi>Epitaph</hi> on a Tomb at <hi>Thebes,</hi> which they aſſur'd him was St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Sepulchre, was made by a <hi>Christian,</hi> meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the word MOIPHC, which he found in it, tho' it alſo mention'd the Immortality of the Soul. The ſame Author ſpeaks more poſitively to this purpoſe, when he refutes the common Opinion concerning the pretended Tomb of a Saint near <hi>Valentia.</hi> He ſays expreſly, that the words <hi>Aethera</hi> and <hi>Superis</hi> mention'd in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription are, in his opinion, ſufficient Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove that it is the Tomb of a Heathen, and ſubjoins this Maxim, That the Stile of <hi>Epitaphs</hi> ought to be diſtinguiſh'd from that of <hi>Poeſie,</hi> by reaſon of the liberty claim'd by Poets of all Religions; whereas he aſſures us that he has always diſcover'd evident marks of the Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Simplicity of the Primitive Church in the Inſcriptions on ancient Tombs. What opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion then do you think this learned Antiquary would have had of the <hi>Gods Manes,</hi> and <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Houſes</hi> of the <hi>Catacombs?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) The <hi>Glaſs Vials</hi> and little <hi>Metallic Veſſels</hi> that have been frequently found in thoſe Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres are alſo marks of <hi>Paganiſm.</hi> The Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the common Opinion concerning the <hi>Catacombs</hi> pretend that theſe Veſſels ſerv'd to contain the Blood of the <hi>Martyrs;</hi> but this is a bare Conjecture, without the leaſt Proof or Illuſtration. And beſides, we have reaſon to conclude, that theſe are true <hi>Lachrymatories,</hi>
                        <pb n="133" facs="tcp:45740:293"/>
ſuch as the Heathens were wont to put both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Urns and Tombs.

                     <p>I confeſs, this Reaſon alone could not have convinc'd me, ſince 'tis certain, as I intimated before, that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> borrow'd ſeveral leſs innocent Cuſtoms from the Heathens. But this Obſervation may ſerve to illuſtrate and confirm the firſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">(4.) There is a Paſſage in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getic</hi> that does not at all agree with the Opinion of thoſe who believe that the ancient <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were uſually buried in the <hi>Catacombs.</hi> That Author complains of the Fury of the <hi>Heathens</hi> who took the Bodies of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> out of their Tombs, and drag'd 'em about the Streets; and 'tis probable, that if once thoſe Perſecutors had diſcover'd theſe Caves, they would have for ever depriv'd the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of 'em.</p>
                     <p n="5">(5.) If I ſhould enquire how the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were able to dig and empty theſe Caves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alarming their Neighbors, and how they diſpos'd of all the Rubbiſh, my Adverſaries would doubtleſs tell me, That this Work was not done in ſecret; and, that the <hi>Peuzzolane</hi> or <hi>Sand</hi> of the <hi>Catacombs</hi> was ſold by the poor Chriſtians, who, for this reaſon, were nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd <hi>Arenarii;</hi> that in the mean time they perform'd the Duties of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in theſe holes, under pretext of burying their Dead. But this Anſwer is by no means
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:45740:294"/>
applicable to the <hi>Catacombs</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> that are hewn out of a Rock.</p>
                     <p>And as for the Nick-name of <hi>Arenarii,</hi> it may be obſerv'd, that this Deriſion of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and Poverty of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> does not prove that they were the only Perſons in <hi>Rome</hi> who were reduc'd to trade in <hi>Sand,</hi> which is the thing that ought to have been demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to remove the Difficulty which may ariſe from our ſuppoſing that other perſons beſides the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were employ'd in digging theſe Holes. Tho' the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Frankfort,</hi> for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are oblig'd to run to any part of the City where a Fire happens to break forth, and to carry Water to quench it; it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Inhabitants of that City remain idle Spectators of their Labours.</p>

                     <p>'Tis the common Opinion here, That theſe Cyphers repreſented in the Margin are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of a Latin P, for <hi>Pro</hi> or <hi>For,</hi> and a Croſs, which ſignifies <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſo that theſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:45740:294"/>
are call'd <hi>Pro Chriſto's.</hi> They conclude from hence, that ſuch Figures are the ſure Marks of the Tomb of a Martyr, or of one that ſuffer'd <hi>Pro Chriſto,</hi> for the Name of Chriſt, and accordingly raiſe the price of the Relicks. But 'tis plain, that theſe Cyphers conſiſt of a X, <hi>Chi,</hi> and a P. <hi>Rho,</hi> which are the two firſt Letters of ΧΡΙΣΤΟΣ; as ΜΑ and ΘΥ ſignifie ΜΑΡΙΑ ΘΥΓΑΤΗΡ, as I obſerv'd in the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Work on the Front of St. <hi>Mary major,</hi> and in ſeveral other places.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chriſtian Epitaphs</hi> that are found here ſerve as little to confirm the adverſe Opinion as the above mention'd <hi>Symbols;</hi> for the Queſtion is not, whether the Bodies of ſome Chriſtians were buried in the <hi>Catacombs,</hi> which is a certain and undoubted Truth. Not only <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Miltiades</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> under the Empire of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> but <hi>Cains</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi> their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, who ſuffer'd Martyrdom with ſome other Chriſtians, by the expreſs Order of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> were all interr'd in theſe Vaults, if we may believe <hi>Platina.</hi> Beſides, it appears by the dates of a great number of Epitaphs, that ſeveral Chriſtians were buried here during the Firſt Ages: And I have ſufficient ground to believe they appropriated theſe Sepulchres entirely to themſelves in the ſucceeding times of Peace and Liberty.</p>
                     <p>Thus we may eaſily comprehend how thoſe <hi>Chriſtian Epitaphs</hi> are to be found in theſe Cells, but after all the Controverſie remains untouch'd; for the burying of Chriſtians here, is not a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to exclude others from being interr'd in thoſe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:45740:295"/>
Holes that were ſet apart for the Dregs of the People.</p>
                     <p>The Pictures of diverſe ſorts and ages in the <hi>Catacombs</hi> at <hi>Naples,</hi> the Faſhions of the <hi>Altars</hi> both there and at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſeveral other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances from which ſome pretend to draw Inferences, give no light to the Controverſie, and deſerve not to be conſider'd. The reaſon of which is, becauſe the Popes of theſe laſt Ages having always look'd upon their <hi>Catacombs</hi> as a profitable Source and Magazine of Relicks, have repair'd 'em in ſeveral places, and made ſuch alterations as they thought moſt proper to ſtrengthen the Opinion of the People, and eſpecially of the Pilgrims, who come from all parts to viſit theſe Holy Places. <hi>Panciroli</hi> makes a long deſcription of theſe Reparations, by the help of which we may eaſily reſolve the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that might ariſe from ſeveral things that are obſerv'd in theſe <hi>Catacombs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I muſt not forget to tell you, that during the time of the <hi>Plague</hi> which rag'd at <hi>Naples,</hi> about forty years ago, the <hi>Catacombs</hi> were the moſt uſual places of burial; and all the Bodies that are to be ſeen there at preſent, are ſuch as were interr'd on that occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Near the Church and Catacombs of St. <hi>Agnes</hi> there is an old round Temple, which ſome think was a Temple of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> This Conceit is grounded only on certain ancient Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Vines and Vintages which are on the Roof, and on the Figures of Grapes, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branches, little <hi>Cupids</hi> gathering and preſſing the Grapes, Veſſels, Tuns, Panniers, and ſuch
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:45740:295"/>
other Appurtenances of <hi>Bacchus</hi> that are to be ſeen on a Tomb of Porphyry in the ſame Temple. But all theſe Circumſtances are not ſufficient to prove, that this Temple was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to him, or that the above-mention'd Tomb is his Sepulchre, eſpecially if we call to mind that <hi>Bacchus</hi> dy'd not at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Since this Temple is but a hundred or ſixſcore paces diſtant from St. <hi>Agnes</hi> Church, which was undoubtedly built by <hi>Constantine,</hi> it may with much greater probability be conjectur'd, that the former was built at the ſame time to ſerve for a <hi>Baptiſtery</hi> to the latter, according to the general Cuſtom of thoſe times; and there is alſo another like Building, which was erected by the ſame Emperor for a <hi>Baptiſtery</hi> to S. <hi>John de Lateran.</hi> Neither the Ornaments of the Roof, nor thoſe of the Tomb, are inconſiſtent with this Opinion, ſince they are alſo <hi>Symbols</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I need not inſiſt longer on theſe Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, ſince the Controverſie was decided long ago by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Fourth, who taking it for granted, that the Bones of <hi>Conſtantia</hi> Daughter to <hi>Conſtantin,</hi> were enclos'd here,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ann.</hi> 1255.</note> took 'em out, and having plac'd 'em as Relicks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Altar which he built in this little Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, dedicated both to St. <hi>Conſtantia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Tabernacle of the high Altar of St. <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> is ſupported by four pretty large and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly-well poliſh'd Pillars of Porphyry. We were inform'd, that the little Statue we ſaw there, was formerly the Statue of a <hi>Pagan Deity,</hi> but has ſince been adopted, and conſecrated to be for the future the Statue of St. <hi>Agnes.</hi> Its
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:45740:296"/>
Mantle deſerves to be attentively conſider'd.</p>
                     <p>I might entertain you with an account of many other Antiquities which I obſerv'd in the Cabinets we have viſited, and particularly in that of the Cavalier <hi>Pietro Paulo Manini,</hi> but my Letters are already ſo ſtuff'd with ſuch Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, that I ſhall content my ſelf with men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning ſome of thoſe that I had time to conſider in the Cabinet of Mr. <hi>Bellori.</hi> The Curioſities it contains are not extraordinarily numerous, but they are all well choſen, and every thing in it is abſolutely rare and perfect. His <hi>Fortuna Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi> is a little <hi>Signum</hi> of Braſs half a foot high, and extreamly well preſerv'd. How odd were the Imaginations of the Heathens! The Gods govern'd the World, while they themſelves were ſubject to the fantaſtical Humours of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune!</hi> This little <hi>Goddeſs</hi> is ſurrounded with, or to ſpeak more properly, compos'd of all the Marks and Characters of Divinity that were proper to other Deities; She has the Beauty of <hi>Venus, Juno</hi>'s Crown, <hi>Diana</hi>'s Creſcent, the Miter of <hi>Iſis, Ceres</hi>'s Horn of Abundance, <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Robe, the Wings of <hi>Fame</hi> or of <hi>Victory, Cupid</hi>'s Quiver, the Goats-skin of <hi>Bacchus, Eſculapius</hi>'s Serpent, <hi>Fortune</hi>'s Rudder, and ſeveral other marks of Gods and Goddeſſes.</p>
                     <p>I obſerv'd alſo the Deify'd <hi>Fauſtina,</hi> with her blown-up Veil ſtrew'd with Stars; the <hi>Magna Mater,</hi> or <hi>Natura rerum parens,</hi> who ſuckles diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Animals at all her Breaſts; the Goddeſs <hi>Fortune,</hi> holding in one Hand the Horn of Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and in the other the Nail of Neceſſity; the <hi>Buſt</hi> of a young <hi>Roman</hi> Nobleman, with his <hi>Bulla aurea</hi> hanging at his Neck; the <hi>Ciſtrum,</hi>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:45740:296"/>
an Inſtrument which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> us'd, before the <hi>Romans,</hi> to aſſemble the People to the Sacrifices. This is a rare Piece, reſembling a little Racket, the Wood pierc'd with four pieces of Braſs like Cords or Rods, which play and make a noiſe: This Inſtrument denoted the four Elements and the Hurry of the World.</p>
                     <p>The ancient Veſſel of brown Earth, but fine, and ſounding like Porcelane, is another of the Rarities in this Cabinet. The Pictures about the Veſſel contain Repreſentations of their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms in bathing; and among others there is a Woman holding in one hand a <hi>Strigil</hi> or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for rubbing off ſweat, and in the other a Veſſel call'd <hi>Guttum,</hi> which contain'd odoriferous Waters. Beſides, there are <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rns, Sepulchral Lamps, Lachrymatories,</hi> rare <hi>Pictures,</hi> and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred other things, which I have not time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.</p>
                     <p>Father <hi>Kircher</hi>'s Cabinet in the <hi>Roman</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege was formerly one of the moſt curious in <hi>Europe,</hi> but it has been very much mangl'd and diſmember'd: yet there remains ſtill a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable collection of natural Rarities, with ſeveral mechanical Engines.</p>
                     <p>It may be juſtly ſaid, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, which is the great College, and principal Houſe of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> is one of the fineſt Palaces in the City; the <hi>Library</hi> is good and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, but there are no ancient Manuſcripts, nor other conſiderable Rarities in it.</p>
                     <p>In a great Hall, which is adorn'd with the Pictures of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> that have ſuffer'd <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> we took notice of the famous <hi>Garnet,</hi> that bold Servant of the <hi>Society,</hi> who was drawn,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:45740:297"/>
hang'd, and quarter'd for the <hi>Gun-Powder Treaſon.</hi> At his ſide there is the Figure of an <hi>Angel,</hi> who encourages him, and ſhews him the Heavens open'd.</p>
                     <p>During the three laſt days of the <hi>Holy Week,</hi> we met with almoſt nothing elſe in the Streets of <hi>Rome</hi> but <hi>Proceſſions</hi> of <hi>Penitents</hi> of all ſorts, and in all ſhapes, who were ſeeking after Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe by another way than that of <hi>Garnet.</hi> They had tapering Hoods which cover'd their Heads, leaving only two holes directly oppoſite to their Eyes: ſome of theſe Penitents were cloath'd in white, others in Violet colour, blew, yellow, and ſeveral other colours; ſome<note n="*" place="margin">'Tis well known that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of 'em are hir'd to play theſe Tricks.</note> laſh'd their own naked Backs with Whips of ſmall twiſted Cords, which made more noiſe than they did execution: theſe are only the puny Scholars of the <hi>Druids</hi> and <hi>Brachman</hi>'s, or, if you will, of the <hi>Indian Faquirs;</hi> but they come very far ſhort of the <hi>Scotopitae</hi> or <hi>Circumcelliones</hi> of the Fourth Age, who were wont to burn themſelves, to cut their own Throats, or to break their Necks for the love of God. There are, and always have been, Fools of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions; This puts me in mind of an Accident that I cannot forbear relating to you, and of which I was an Eye-witneſs. In <hi>June</hi> 1683. there was an unhappy Creature hang'd at<note n="†" place="margin">The ſecond City in <hi>Poictou.</hi>

Town. He went ſtraight up to the top of the Ladder, which was not yet taken away, and untying the Rope that ſerv'd him for a Girdle, he put it about his Neck with a running Knot, and faſten'd it to the Gibbet: after which he began very gravely to harangue the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, alledging ſeveral Reaſons to excuſe the dead Wench, for whoſe Ranſom he ſaid he had offer'd his Life. He added, That his Crimes exceeded hers, and that he was reſolv'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate 'em by a ſudden and voluntary Death: in the mean time the People laugh'd at him, not imagining that he was Fool enough to hang himſelf; for he was generally known, and the Bigots had a good opinion of him. However, he ventur'd on the fatal leap, and his Tongue hung out of his Mouth a large minute before any perſon came to his aſſiſtance; but at laſt<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>There was not ſo numerous a concourſe of Pilgrims this year as has been formerly. I have read in a Deſcription of <hi>Trinity Hoſpital,</hi> that in the year 1600, which was the laſt of the great Jubilee, that Houſe receiv'd, according to the uſual Cuſtom, or took care to provide for Four hundred and Forty thouſand and Five hundred Men, beſides Five and twenty thouſand and Five

hundred Women. The <hi>Italian</hi> Pilgrims are lodg'd and entertain'd here three days, but thoſe who come from beyond Sea, or from the other ſide of the Mountains, are allow'd one day lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Princes, Princeſſes, Cardinals, and the Pope himſelf, waſh their Feet, and ſerve 'em at Table.</p>
                     <p>I muſt not forget to tell you, that we never yet met the <hi>Sacrament</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> nor in any other Town in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſave only at <hi>Venice,</hi> where we ſaw it twice, under a magnificent Canopy not unlike to the Doge's <hi>Ombrella,</hi> and ſurrounded with a great number of Torches. The People of this Country are not at all poſſeſs'd with a ſpirit of Hatred or Perſecution againſt Strangers of what Religion ſoever; and I muſt do 'em the Juſtice to acknowledge, that in our Travels through <hi>Italy,</hi> and even at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Loretto,</hi> we were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the leaſt moleſted by thoſe Adorers of Relicks and Images; for they are accuſtom'd to ſee Strangers enjoy a great deal of Freedom, and the rougheſt treatment we ever receiv'd from 'em was, to be greeted now and then with a <hi>Non ſono Chriſtiani.</hi>

or Slime, and of ſandy Earth mix'd with Shells, and other Marine Bodies, eſpecially in Countries ſubject to Earthquakes, may well admit of ſuch an Explication. But after all, I ſee no reaſon that ſhould oblige us to take ſo wide a compaſs for a ſatisfactory ſolution of this <hi>Phaenomenon;</hi> for, to give you my thoughts of it in few words, I think it may be eaſily comprehended, that the ſame Vertue and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties by which Shells are generated in the Sea may alſo form 'em in the Land, ſince there are Subſtances equally fit for their production in both, and all the circumſtances and means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd for their formation may be found in the latter as well as in the former. I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a nice enquiry, whether they are form'd by <hi>Vegetation,</hi> or to uſe the Phraſe of ſome Authors, by <hi>Intro ſuſception,</hi> almoſt after the ſame manner as Plants are ſuppos'd to be nouriſh'd; or by <hi>Juxta poſition</hi> and <hi>Incruſtation,</hi> as <hi>Bezoar</hi> (whether <hi>Foſſile</hi> or otherwiſe generated) is produc'd, or Stones grow in the Kidneys. But chuſe which Hypotheſis you will, and after you have dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently examin'd the Formation of Shells in thoſe places which you call their natural Beds, it will appear, that the ſame account may be given of the Shells on the Hills of <hi>Certaldo</hi> as of thoſe that are found on the ſhore at <hi>Leghorn,</hi> excepting only thoſe that are ſaid to be genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Animals by the Seed in the Eggs.</p>
                     <p>I foreſee one Objection which you will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly urge againſt me, if you be not prevented by a timely Anſwer. You will tell me, that Shells are inſeparable from Fiſhes, Snails, or
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:45740:305"/>
other ſuch like Animals, for whoſe uſe alone Nature produces 'em, according to the common Axiom, That <hi>Nature does nothing in vain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To diſpatch this pretended Difficulty without wandering from the ſubject of our preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, I ſhall only put you in mind of thoſe Shells that are ſometimes found in the Kidneys, Impoſthumes, and Stomach, of which we have ſuch<note n="*" place="margin">See the <hi>Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velles de la Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique des Lettres</hi> for <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 1686.</hi> See alſo <hi>Pareus,</hi> and other <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomical Writers.</hi>
                        </note> exact and late accounts, that the Matter of Fact is undoubtedly certain: for if I ſhould ask you for what Creatures theſe Shells are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, you muſt be forc'd to have recourſe to ſome Diſtinctions of your Aphoriſm, which may be eaſily accommodated to my <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you think to elude the force of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, by ſaying, That a Shell in an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthume is a ſort of Monſter, from which we muſt not draw a general Concluſion; I anſwer, That I will neither diſpute about Words, nor make too general Concluſions. If Shells in the Kidneys, or in Impoſthumes, be call'd <hi>Monſters</hi> in your Dictionary, you may, if you pleaſe, beſtow the ſame Title on thoſe of <hi>Certaldo.</hi> Neither muſt you ſtart new Difficulties, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the multitude of theſe with the ſmall number of thoſe others; for if the Kidney were as big as a Mountain, and contain'd as great a quantity of Matter fit for the formation of Shells, as the Hill of <hi>Certaldo,</hi> we ſhould doubtleſs find Ten thouſand Shells inſtead of one in that part of the Body; and Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Monſters of the ſame nature, form'd at the ſame time, in the ſame place, and by the ſame Accident, ought not to be reckon'd more than One.</p>

                        <pb n="157" facs="tcp:45740:305"/>I could eaſily anſwer all your Objections after the ſame manner, but, for a further illuſtration of my <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> I ſhall conſider more particularly the word <hi>in vain, Nature does nothing in vain,</hi> 'tis true; but that Shells without Fiſhes are uſeleſs Productions of Nature, I deny. The variety of the Works of God in all his Creatures is univerſally acknowledg'd, and the reaſon of it is plain. Thus thoſe <hi>Foſſil</hi> Shells that are found in the Heart of Stones and Marble, were not made <hi>in vain;</hi> tho' they never enclos'd a Fiſh, nor any other living Creature. The Stones call'd <hi>Ammon</hi>'s <hi>Horns,</hi> were not form'd <hi>in vain;</hi> tho' they never grac'd the Forehead of a Ram.

                     <p>I Would not neglect the occaſion of writing to you the day after our arrival at <hi>Florence,</hi> tho' I could not then give you any account of this lovely City. We have ſeen ſo many things in it ſince, that my Journal would furniſh me with ſufficient matter for a Volume. But, in purſuance of my wonted method, I ſhall in the firſt place give you a brief deſcription of it, and afterwards proceed to communicate ſome particular Obſervations, which perhaps will be new to you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Florence,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> Seat of an Archbiſhop, and Reſidence of the <hi>Great Duke,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>FLORENCE</hi> the Fair.</note> is ſituated on the River <hi>Arno,</hi> as it were in the middle of the <hi>Arena</hi> or bottom of an Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theater. At the diſtance of four or five miles, excepting only the ſide that looks towards <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoya,</hi> it is ſurrounded with very fertile Hillocks, which riſe inſenſibly, and by degrees unite themſelves to the high Mountains. The vaſt number of Houſes which cover both the little Hills, and the interjacent Plain, make a very delightful and admirable Proſpect. If from one of the Towers of <hi>Florence</hi> you took a view of this large Bottom, ſo full of Villages and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:45740:312"/>
of Pleaſure, you would think it were an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt infinite continuation of the Suburbs of the Town; and it may be juſtly ſaid, that this rich and delicious Valley is the beſt inhabited place in the World.</p>
                     <p>I was inform'd by a curious and exact Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the Walls of this City are juſt Fifteen thouſand Two hundred and forty <hi>Braſſes</hi> or Fathoms in compaſs; and that the River <hi>Arno,</hi> which runs thro' it, is Five hundred Fathoms broad; ſo that reckoning the double breadth of the River, with the circumference of the Walls, the Circuit of <hi>Florence</hi> amounts in all to Sixteen thouſand Two hundred and forty fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms. Three of theſe Fathoms make exactly five Feet and eight Inches <hi>Engliſh</hi> meaſure; and conſequently 16240 Fathoms amount to Thirty thouſand ſix hundred and ſeventy five Feet, which you may reduce as you think fit. The City is pretty round.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Perſon aſſur'd me, that <hi>Florence</hi> contains within its Walls Eight thouſand and eight hundred Houſes, Sixty thouſand Souls, Two and twenty Hoſpitals, Eighty and nine Convents, Fourſcore and four Fraternities, a Hundred fifty and two Churches, Eighteen Halls or Galleries belonging to Merchants, Seventy and two Courts of Juſtice, ſix Columns, two Pyramids, four Bridges, ſeven Fountains, ſeventeen <hi>Places</hi> or <hi>Courts,</hi> and a Hundred and ſixty public Statues. The Streets are pav'd with large pieces of a greyiſh Stone, call'd <hi>Pietra forte,</hi> which is brought from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Quarries. A good number of the Houſes are built with the ſame Stone, and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:45740:312"/>
many of 'em are extraordinarily large and beautiful. And even there are ſome who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that the <hi>Florentine Palaces,</hi> to ſpeak after the <hi>Italian</hi> manner are the handſomeſt Structures in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The<note n="*" place="margin">Near the great Gate of this Palace there is a large Magnet, which was ſpoil'd by the Fire. <hi>Spon</hi> ſays, that it weighs <hi>5000</hi> pounds.</note> Palace <hi>Pitti,</hi> where the <hi>Great Duke</hi> lodges, is a magnificent Building, and extoll'd beyond meaſure by the People of the Country. Yet I obſerv'd one fault in it, which is the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs of the Court with reſpect to the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: you will be of the ſame opinion after I have told you, that the heighth of the Palace to the Corniſh of the third Order amounts to a hundred and twenty two feet, and yet the Court is but a hundred and ſixty foot long, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty broad: ſo that you cannot chuſe a place in all the Court to view the Palace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lifting up your Head in a very troubleſome manner.</p>
                     <p>Before we enter'd into the old Ducal Palace,<note place="margin">The four Statues of white Marble on the Bridge of the <hi>Trinity</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the four <hi>Seaſons.</hi> They were made by <hi>Michael Angelo.</hi>
                        </note> where all thoſe rare and precious things are to be ſeen that make ſo great a noiſe in the World, we took a view of the Statues in the <hi>Place</hi> or Court. I ſhall only name theſe following; the <hi>David,</hi> by <hi>Michael Angelo;</hi> the <hi>Judith,</hi> by <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telli;</hi> the fair <hi>Sabin</hi> Woman violently carried away, by <hi>John of Bologna;</hi> the <hi>Perſeus</hi> of Braſs, by <hi>Cellini;</hi> the <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Cacus,</hi> by <hi>Bandinelli;</hi> and the Braſs Statue on Horſeback of <hi>Coſmo</hi> I, by <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Bologna.</hi> Theſe are all admirable Pieces.

                     <p>The great Gallery of the Palace is almoſt Four hundred foot long; the underfretting of the Roof is painted; and we walk'd between two Ranks of Statues and Buſts, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Antique Pieces. On the top, againſt the Wall, are the Portraictures of the ancient Philoſophers on one ſide, and thoſe of famous Captains on the other.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>From this Gallery we paſs'd thro' ſeveral Chambers full of Rarities.

                        <hi>Diamond</hi> which juſtly claims the firſt rank among the Jewels of this Cabinet. Among other Rarities theſe deſerve to be mention'd: an antique Head of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> of one entire Turquoiſe as big as an Egg; a Cupboard full of Veſſels of Agat, <hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> Cornelian, and Cryſtal of the Rock, the whole garniſh'd with Gold and fine Jewels; a large Table and Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of inlaid Work, wholly compos'd of orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Jaſper, Calcedony, Rubies, Topazes, and other Precious ſtones admirably well wrought; a Collection of very rare Medals; a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous number of antique Pieces of carv'd and engrav'd Work, very entire, and extreamly well kept; ſelect Pictures, or, to ſpeak more properly, Maſterpieces of the moſt excellent Painters; ſix <hi>Grecian Statues</hi> unconceivably beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful; two Men wreſtling; the Peaſant whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Bill, and at the ſame time liſtening to <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Conſpiracy; a <hi>Fawn;</hi> a ſleeping <hi>Cupid;</hi> a <hi>Venus</hi> ſix foot high, and another ſmaller by a foot, both of white Marble.</p>

                     <p>The fineſt Statues in this Church are, the St. <hi>James,</hi> by <hi>Sanſovin,</hi> againſt one of the Pillars which ſupport the Dome; the <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> behind the great Altar, by <hi>Bandinello;</hi> the Statue of <hi>God the Father,</hi> the <hi>Dead Chriſt,</hi> and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſupporting him, on the ſame Altar, and by the ſame Hand.

                     <p>The Painting in the Dome repreſents the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and is the Work of <hi>Fred. Zucchero.</hi> It is highly eſteem'd, tho' the Painter is blam'd for repreſenting his Riſing Bodies cloth'd and of different ages.</p>

                     <p>The Pieces of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s and <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rods are two of the moſt curious Relics in the Cathedral, tho' they ſeem to be of doubtful credit, ſince both the entire Rods are ſaid to be at <hi>St. John de Lateran.</hi>

                     <p>The Steeple is very near the Church, which is a ſquare Tower a hundred and eighty foot high, overlaid with ſquare pieces of red, white,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:45740:315"/>
and black Marble, and adorn'd with ſeveral Statues. The old bald Man, by <hi>Donatelli</hi> is an excellent Piece. 'Tis ſaid that Sculptor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd his <hi>Zuccon</hi> before all his other Works, for that Figure repreſented one of his Friends, and really merited a particular Eſteem.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Baptiſtery</hi> is lin'd in the ſame manner as the Church, and its Structure is almoſt like to that of the <hi>Baptiſtery</hi> at <hi>Piſa;</hi> 'tis believ'd that it was formerly a Temple of <hi>Mars.</hi> After the Alterations that were made in it, when the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral was built, it was appointed to ſerve for a <hi>Baptiſtery,</hi> and dedicated to St. <hi>John Baptiſt.</hi> The <hi>Moſaic</hi> Work on the arch'd Roof is much valu'd; and among the Statues contain'd in this Temple, the <hi>Magdalen</hi> of Wood, by <hi>Donatelli,</hi> is particularly eſteem'd. But the moſt admir'd Pieces are, the three brazen Gates, adorn'd with <hi>Baſſo-relievo's</hi> repreſenting ſome ſacred Hiſtories. That on the Back-ſide, with this Inſcription, <hi>Andreas <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>golini de Piſis me fecit</hi> 1330. is the leaſt conſiderable, the other two are ſingularly beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful. They never forget to tell Strangers, that <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> thought he could not admire 'em ſufficiently, and eſteem'd 'em worthy to be the Gates of Heaven.</p>

                        <pb n="178" facs="tcp:45740:316"/>In the Court oppoſite to the middle Gate of this Baptiſtery, there are two Columns of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry chain'd together, tho' they ſtand at ſome diſtance from each other. The Story ſays, That the <hi>Florentins</hi> having aſſiſted the <hi>Piſans</hi> to conquer ſome part of the Iſle of <hi>Majorca,</hi> ask'd two Pillars, which they found among the Spoils of the Enemies. Some add, That the <hi>Piſans</hi> being loth to part with theſe Monuments, but not daring to refuſe 'em to their Allies, ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully tarniſh'd their Luſtre in the Fire, and ſent 'em in that condition cover'd with Velvet. But this Circumſtance is deny'd by others.</p>
                     <p>I had almoſt forgot to mention the other Column which ſtands not far from the former: it was ſet up for a Memorial of a pretended Miracle which happen'd in that place, when the Body of St. <hi>Zenobius</hi> was remov'd from St. <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>'s to the Cathedral. His Shrine, ſays the Tradition, touch'd by chance the Trunk of a dry Tree which lay there, and immediately the Tree bloſſom'd, and put forth both Flowers and Fruit; I have forgot the reſt of the Story.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Lawrence</hi>'s Church is very large and rich; and I may venture to ſay, without being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> that the famous Chapel, on which they have wrought ſo long, and with ſo much aſſiduity, will, when finiſh'd, be the fineſt Edifice of that nature in the World. I dare not undertake to deſcribe it, but I cannot forbear to give you ſome Idea of it.</p>
                     <p>This magnificent Chapel is very large and high. In the middle of each Face of the <hi>Hexagon</hi> there riſes a double Pilaſter of Jaſper, with a double Chapiter of Braſs gilt, the Baſe being alſo of the ſame matter. On the Pedeſtal
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:45740:316"/>
of each Pilaſter there are ſeveral Emblematical Figures compos'd of Precious Stones joyn'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all the Art imaginable. In the ſix Angles there are ſix ſtately Tombs of Porphyry, Oriental Granate, and ſome other of the moſt precious kinds of Marble. On each Tomb there is a great<note n="*" place="margin">'Tis ſaid, that each Pillow coſt Sixty thouſand Crowns.</note> Pillow of Jaſper enrich'd with divers ſorts of Jewels, and on each Pillow a Crown, which is yet a great deal richer. The Pedeſtal or Baſe that ſupports the Tombs is overlaid with Porphyry and Calcedony, on which will be engrav'd the Epitaphs of the Princes for whom theſe Tombs are deſign'd. Their Statues of Braſs gilt, twice as big as the Life, will be plac'd in the Niches of black Marble that are already prepar'd in the Wall over the Tombs. The inner Roof of the Dome will be of pure <hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> with Roſes and other Ornaments gilt. All the reſt of the Walls is lin'd in Compartments with fine Agats, rare Granates, Onyxes, and all ſorts of Stones that are eſteem'd precious; each Pannel being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into ſquares, and embelliſh'd with other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of Copper gilt. The Altar will ſurpaſs all the other parts of this admirable Structure; and to comprehend the Beauties of 'em all, your Imagination muſt riſe higher than my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Deſcription is able to carry it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Library</hi> of St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> is particularly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for its <hi>Manuſcripts.</hi>

to tell you, that M. <hi>Magliabecchi</hi> could not favour me with a ſight of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Letter to <hi>Caeſarius,</hi> having receiv'd expreſs Orders from the <hi>Great Duke</hi> not to communicate it to any perſon whatſoever.

                     <p>We went alſo to the Church of the <hi>Holy Croſs,</hi> principally to ſee the Tomb of <hi>Michael Angelo;</hi> which is certainly a very conſiderable Monument; tho', in my opinion, not altogether ſuitable to the Merit of ſo great a perſon. In the Chapel belonging to the Family of the <hi>Zanchini,</hi> in the ſame Church, we obſerv'd on the Altar a Picture by <hi>Angelo Bronzini,</hi> in which <hi>Christ</hi> is repreſented delivering the Souls of the Fathers; among whom there are many Female Spirits that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear too gay and airy for an Altar-piece. And even ſome ſay, That ſhe who bears the Name of <hi>Eve</hi> is the true Reſemblance of the Painter's Miſtriſs. They add alſo, that the Figure of a Man at the right corner of the Picture below, looking ſtedfaſtly on the pretended <hi>Eve,</hi> is <hi>Bron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zini</hi>'s own Phiz. This puts me in mind of <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turicchio,</hi> who, in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> painted Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Sixth proſtrate at the Feet of <hi>Julia Farneſe,</hi> under pretext of making him adore the <hi>Virgin.</hi>

                     <p>When I reflect on the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Offer, and the Obſtinacy of that little <hi>Republic,</hi> I cannot forbear ſuſpecting that there was ſome Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the <hi>Golden Circle:</hi> If <hi>Frederic</hi> had intended to make his promis'd Chain heavy, 'tis probable he would have offer'd ſome particular Sum, without uſing the ambiguous Expreſſions of <hi>Circles</hi> and <hi>Surrounding.</hi> And the <hi>Bononians</hi> would not have been ſo inexorable, if they had not fear'd to be deceiv'd, and perhaps imagin'd that the <hi>Circle</hi> would at laſt dwindle into a Thread.</p>

                        <hi>Aſinelli</hi> there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, call'd <hi>Gariſenda,</hi> which leans like the Tower
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:45740:322"/>

                     <p>The Opinion of thoſe who pretend that this Monument was purpoſely erected in a leaning poſture, does certainly proceed from their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. It is a ſquare and even Tower built of Brick, like that of <hi>Siena</hi> and <hi>Viterbo,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in one of my preceding Letters; it was not deſign'd for an Ornament, nor erected to diſplay the Wit of the Architect; and, without doubt, it was more for the Intereſt of thoſe that built it to ſecure the ſtability of its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, than to affect an uſeleſs ſingularity in its Structure. And, after all, it would not be a very difficult task to build an enclining Tower; you are not ignorant of the Reaſons on which ſuch an Operation might be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and you may try the Experiment when you pleaſe, by making a pile of the Men on your Tables. This Tower puts me in mind of a Story related by <hi>Childrey,</hi> one of your <hi>Engliſh Naturaliſts,</hi> that there is a Steeple in <hi>Briſtol</hi> which is variouſly agitated, according to the motion of the Bells.</p>
                     <p>Before I came hither I had ſeen the Epitaph of that <hi>Proculus</hi> who lies interr'd in St. <hi>Proculus</hi>'s <hi>Church</hi> in this City;
<q>
                           <l>Si <hi>procul</hi> à <hi>Proculo, Proculi</hi> campana fuiſſet;</l>

But I always fancy'd, according to the common Opinion, that St. <hi>Proculus</hi>'s Bell had knock'd out his Nameſake's Brains; whereas I'm inform'd here, that this <hi>Proculus</hi> being a very ſtudious perſon, accuſtom'd himſelf for ſeveral years to riſe every Morning at the ſound of that Bell; which was at laſt the occaſion of his death.</p>

                     <p>OUR Calaſhes brought us in four hours from <hi>Modena</hi> to <hi>Regio.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">REGIO.</note> There is nothing particularly remarkable in this City; but in the general 'tis better built, and more pleaſant than <hi>Modena.</hi> They boaſt much of their<note n="*" place="margin">

Their fineſt Works in Bone are paltry little Rings, ſold for Six-pence a dozen, Death-heads, Shrines for Relicks, <hi>Agnus Dei</hi>'s, and Croſſes, all which are made with Tools like Hedging Bills. They have ſtore of<note n="†" place="margin">Or Images of our Lady.</note> 
                        <hi>Madones,</hi> and Relicks. I am inform'd, that ſome ancient Inſcriptions have been found at <hi>Regio,</hi> in which that City is call'd <hi>Regium Lepidi,</hi> without mentioning who that <hi>Lepidus</hi> was. The other <hi>Regio</hi> in <hi>Calabria ulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior</hi> bore the name of <hi>Regium Julium;</hi> and 'tis obſerv'd, that the Inhabitants of the firſt were by the <hi>Latin</hi> Authors call'd <hi>Regienſes,</hi> whereas thoſe of the latter were nam'd <hi>Rhegini.</hi> And the laſt <hi>Regium</hi> or <hi>Rhegium</hi> is alſo thought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from the <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

                        <pb n="196" facs="tcp:45740:325"/>
is divided, and as it were broken from <hi>Sicily</hi> at that place.</p>
                     <p>The Inhabitants of our <hi>Regio</hi> ſtile their Prince Duke of <hi>Regio</hi> and <hi>Modena;</hi> as, you know, the <hi>Scots</hi> put the name of their Country before that of <hi>England,</hi> in the Title of the King.</p>
                     <p>Eight miles from <hi>Regio</hi> we paſs'd over the River <hi>Enſa</hi> on a Bridge, and enter'd, on the other ſide, into the Dutchy of <hi>Parma.</hi> The Country is ſtill plain, but we meet with many Paſtures; whereas about <hi>Bologna</hi> and <hi>Modena</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Grounds are till'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parma</hi> is ſeventeen miles from the Bridge of <hi>Enſa;</hi> we perceiv'd the City at a conſiderable diſtance, becauſe of the breadth and ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Road that leads to it, which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers its higheſt Spires. The entry into it is very pleaſant, and the City it ſelf deſerves the ſame Character. Over the Gate thro' which we enter'd we ſaw the Arms of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> III. You know that Pontife created his Baſtard Son <hi>Lewis,</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Placenza,</hi> theſe Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories having been before united to the <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal State.</hi> The Citadel of <hi>Parma</hi> was built on the Model of that of <hi>Antwerp;</hi> and the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the City are alſo very good. It is divided by the River of <hi>Parma,</hi> which runs thro' the middle of it; but this River is not navigable.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing extraordinary in the Ducal Palace, but they are building another which will be larger and more regular. The Stables are handſom, the Coaches very rich, and the Wardrobe well furniſh'd. The great Theater
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:45740:325"/>
is a very rare Structure, and neither <hi>Paris</hi> nor <hi>Venice</hi> can boaſt of the like. It is extreamly large, and yet the ſofteſt Whiſper may be heard thro' all the parts of it. Inſtead of Boxes, the Floor is ſurrounded with Benches, rais'd after the manner of an Amphitheater: It is alſo much larger than the Floors of Theaters are uſually made, and may be fill'd with Water to the heighth of above three feet. This little Lake is cover'd with gilt Boats, which make a very charming Spectacle, by the help of a fine illumination.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the ordinary Schools of the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there is a large and fair College, call'd the College of the Nobility. They receive Scholars of all Nations, who are capable of being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Knights of <hi>Malta.</hi> Not only the Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but all manner of Exerciſes are taught here; and the Penſions are different, according to the variety of the Studies. The Scholars eat toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Refectory, and their number at preſent amounts to Two hundred and thirty.</p>
                     <p>The Dome of the Cathedral was painted by <hi>Corregio;</hi> and there are ſeveral good Pictures in the<note n="*" place="margin">At St. <hi>John</hi>'s and St. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>'s.</note> Principal Churches.</p>
                     <p>We ſaw a great deal of good Company at the Race, eſpecially fair and handſom Women, but they obſerve the ridiculous Cuſtoms of <hi>Rome:</hi> for Perſons of different Sexes never go into the ſame Coach; you may ſee a heap of Men in one Coach, and a troop of Women in another; and they would be as much aſham'd to be ſeen together, as to walk ſtark naked about the Streets. Is there not a ſtrange Medley of Humours and Prejudices in the <hi>World?</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Parma</hi> is 35 miles diſtant from <hi>Placenza.</hi> In our Journey thither we paſs'd by a little diſman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled Town call'd St. <hi>Donino;</hi> we ſaw neither Villages nor Rivers on all this Road, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be mention'd.</p>

                        </gap>ces from the <hi>Po.</hi> It is a pleaſant Town, bigger than <hi>Parma;</hi> the Houſes are low, but very prettily built. The Race-ſtreet, which they call the <hi>Stradone,</hi> is ſtreight as a Line, and of an equal breadth throughout. Next the Houſes, on each ſide of it, there is a Foot-path fenc'd in by a row of Three hundred Poſts, as at <hi>London;</hi> theſe Poſts are juſt ten foot diſtant from each other; whence 'tis plain, that the whole Street is 3000 foot long.</p>
                     <p>The Statues of <hi>Alexander Farneſe</hi> Governor of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> and of his Son <hi>Rainuccio</hi> the Firſt, are in the great Place.</p>
                     <p>We went up to the top of the higheſt Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, according to our uſual cuſtom, from whence we diſcover'd an admirable Landskip, extreamly embelliſh'd by the courſe of the <hi>Po;</hi> and even ſaw <hi>Cremona</hi> diſtinctly, which is twenty miles diſtant from this place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">There are ſome Pictures by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rache</hi> in the <hi>Cathedral;</hi> and an Image of <hi>our Lady</hi> by <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael,</hi> at St. <hi>Sixtus</hi>'s. <hi>Hug.</hi>
                        </note>I have not thought fit to mention the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this City, and am reſolv'd hereafter to trouble you very rarely with Deſcriptions of that nature; for, as I intimated to you before, when one's Head is full of the Idea's of ſuch magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Churches as we have ſeen, 'tis almoſt a pain to him to look upon any others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="199" facs="tcp:45740:326"/>I ſhall only add concerning <hi>Placenza,</hi> that it is thinly inhabited; that the Houſes are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally built of Brick; and that its Weights, Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and Coyns are different from thoſe of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi> Its Fortifications are not very conſiderable, tho' they are commonly much extoll'd. The <hi>Pomaerium</hi> is ſurrounded with Poſts, without any Buildings; I know not whether I made the ſame Obſervation concerning <hi>Leghorn,</hi> in one of my former Letters.</p>
                     <p>We follow'd the courſe of the <hi>Po,</hi> at ſome diſtance, till we came over againſt <hi>Cremona,</hi> where we croſs'd over the River in a Ferry-boat. There are no Bridges on the <hi>Po</hi> below <hi>Turin.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Cremona</hi> is ſeated on the left Bank of that River, in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">CREMONA.</note> 'Tis a pretty large City, but even poorer and leſs populous than <hi>Placenza.</hi> There is nothing at all to be ſeen in it, tho' its Tower and Caſtle are very much extoll'd. One of their Authors has the confidence to tell the World, That <hi>the Tower is reckon'd to exceed all others in heighth, and for that reaſon eſteem'd one of the Wonders of</hi> Europe; and That <hi>the Caſtle is the ſtrongeſt and moſt formidable Citadel in</hi> Italy. If I had not been accuſtom'd to the lofty and hyperbolical Expreſſions of the <hi>Italians,</hi> I ſhould have been ſtrangely ſurpriz'd, after all theſe Rhodomontades, to find nothing at <hi>Cremona</hi> worth obſervation. The Caſtle is an old, ſhapeleſs, and half-ruin'd Maſs, which in its beſt ſtate deſerv'd not to be compar'd to a well contriv'd Fort, but perhaps might have been reputed tolerable in the days of Croſs-bows. And the Tower is neither handſom nor very
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:45740:327"/>
high, but inferior to a thouſand that are not ſo much as mention'd. It was built by <hi>Frederic Barbaroſſa, An.</hi> 1184. There is a Tradition, that the Emperor <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> and Pope <hi>John</hi> XXIII, went up to this Tower, with a certain<note n="*" place="margin">Gabrino Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulio <hi>Tyrant of</hi> Cremona. C. Tor.</note> Lord of <hi>Cremona,</hi> who repented afterwards, as he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times declar'd, That he did not throw 'em down from top to bottom, meerly for the rarity of the thing. And perhaps it was this Story that gave the firſt occaſion to the Reflexions that have been made on the heighth of this Tower.</p>
                     <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Cremona</hi> boaſt much of the Antiquity of their City, but they produce not any Monuments to confirm it. The Antiquity of <hi>Cremona</hi> has a very near reſemblance to that of the <hi>Po.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the diſtance of Forty miles from <hi>Cremona</hi> to <hi>Mantua,</hi> we ſaw nothing but Hamlets that deſerve not to be nam'd.<note place="margin">BOZZOLO.</note> Only <hi>Bozzolo</hi> is a ſort of a little City, enclos'd with certain Works which paſs for Fortifications.

                     </p>
                     <p>I ſoon perceiv'd, that neither the Geographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Charts, nor the other Deſcriptions I had ſeen of <hi>Mantua</hi> had given me a juſt Idea of its ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;<note place="margin">MANTUA.</note> for it is uſually but falſly repreſented in the midſt of a Lake, with which it is almoſt equally ſurrounded. To rectifie this Miſtake,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:45740:327"/>
it muſt be obſerv'd, that the<note n="*" place="margin">Which comes from the Lake of <hi>Guarda.</hi>
                        </note> River <hi>Mincio</hi> meeting with a flat Country, makes a kind of Mariſh about twelve or fifteen times longer than broad: and that the City is built on a ſpot of firm Land, within the Mariſh, but towards one ſide of it. Before we enter'd the City, we paſs'd over a Cauſey,<note place="margin">The <hi>Marquiſat</hi> of <hi>Mantua</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to the Title of a <hi>Dutchy</hi> by <hi>Charles V, An. 1530.</hi>
                        </note> which is not above two or three hundred paces long; but on the other ſide which looks towards <hi>Verona,</hi> the Mariſh, or Lake (if it muſt be ſo call'd) is much wider. In ſome parts of it the Water is always in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in others it ſtagnates and infects the Air to ſuch a degree, that during the great Heats, the City is only inhabited by ſuch who cannot conveniently leave it.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation of <hi>Mantua</hi> is not unlike to that of <hi>Peronne,</hi> but with this difference, that the laſt, beſides its Mariſh, is well fortified; whereas <hi>Mantua</hi> is enclos'd only with a Wall, tho' 'tis alſo defended by a ſtrong Citadel.</p>
                     <p>This City is of an indifferent largeneſs, about the bigneſs of <hi>Cremona,</hi> but much ſuperior to it both in Riches and in the number of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. Some of the Streets are broad and ſtreight, but the Houſes are generally unequal, and almoſt all very indifferent. I have ſeen a printed deſcription of the Ducal Palace, in which that Building is extoll'd as the moſt magnificent Structure in <hi>Italy.</hi> 'Tis plain, that the Author wracks his Fancy to invent new Terms, as if thoſe that are now in uſe were not ſtrong enough to expreſs the Grandeur of his Subject; but ſuch a groundleſs Zeal muſt either be an Effect of an exceſſive and unwarrantable Complaiſance, or proceed from an unjuſt Prejudice. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:45740:328"/>
of this Structure is neither beautiful nor regular; and I can aſſure you from my own Experience, that a Stranger may paſs by it, and even look upon it and touch it, without imagining it to be a Palace. 'Tis true, there are many Galleries and Apartments in it, and therefore it may be call'd <hi>large</hi> and <hi>commodious,</hi> which are the higheſt Epithets that can be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd on it, as well as on <hi>White hall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our Guides aſſur'd us, that this Palace was very richly and magnificently furniſh'd before it was<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>The</hi> 18th <hi>of</hi> July, 1630.</note> pillag'd by the Imperial Army. It ſeems ſucceeding Princes have been diſcourag'd by the greatneſs of that loſs from endeavouring afterwards to repair it; for many of the Rooms remain ſtill empty. Nevertheleſs, it muſt be acknowledg'd, that there is not the leaſt defect in the Duke's Apartment: the Hall of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities is full of rare and fine Pieces, and the Cabinet of Curioſities is extreamly well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd.</p>
                     <p>Of ſeven or eight Pleaſure-houſes that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> we ſaw only <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirol</hi> and <hi>la Favorite,</hi> which are very lovely Seats. <hi>Marmirol</hi> eſpecially is a charming place, admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly well furniſh'd, adorn'd with Pictures and Antiquities, and embelliſh'd with ſeveral Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Orange-walks, Bird-houſes, and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; beſides which it enjoys the advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Neighbourhood of a Wood, and of a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and limpid Brook.</p>

                     <p>The Inundation of the River <hi>Adda,</hi> which comes from the Lake of <hi>Como,</hi> oblig'd us to leave our Calaſhes at a Village call'd <hi>Canonica,</hi> twelve miles from <hi>Bergamo,</hi> where we paſs'd over the River in a Boat, tho' not without a great deal of difficulty, by reaſon of its extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rapidity.

                     <p>'Tis ſaid, that many Engineers had in vain attempted to bring the Waters of the <hi>Adda</hi> to <hi>Milan</hi> by way of a Canal, till at laſt <hi>Leonard de Vinci,</hi> the moſt accompliſh'd man of his Age, undertook and finiſh'd the work.</p>

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:45740:331"/>
ſtock of Merit than ever any Man before him could boaſt of. I cannot forbear making a ſhort digreſſion on this occaſion, which I hope will not offend you. That illuſtrious <hi>Florentine</hi> was a man of great ſtature, of a good aſpect, and ſweet temper: he was prudent, courteous, full of Wit, Courage, and Generoſity. He was ſo prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly ſtrong, that he was able with one Hand to twiſt the Clapper of a Bell. He was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Horſeman, danc'd admirably well, was brave and dextrous in managing all ſorts of <hi>Weapons,</hi> and a perfect Maſter in all genteel Exerciſes. All the <hi>World</hi> knows, that he was one of the beſt Painters of the Age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that he and <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> made <hi>Raphael</hi> leave his firſt way of Drawing. Beſides all theſe excellent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, our <hi>Leonard</hi> was a skilful Architect, a good Sculptor, a great Maſter in Mechanics, a learned Mathematician, Muſician, Anatomiſt, Philoſopher, Poet and Hiſtorian. Providence could not in Juſtice put an end to ſo rare a Life without a diſtinguiſhing Event. At the age of Seventy and Five years he fell ſick at <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt honour'd him with a Viſit; he endeavour'd to expreſs his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of ſo great a Favour, by raiſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up, and expir'd in the King's Arms, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to hinder him from riſing.</p>
                     <p>The Merit of this great Perſon was the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Diſcourſe in our paſſage along his lovely <hi>Canal,</hi> which gave us the proſpect of a delicious Country on both ſides, and is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places border'd with pleaſant Houſes, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards and Gardens, like that which leads from <hi>Delft</hi> to <hi>Leyden,</hi> or from <hi>Amſterdam to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht.</hi>

                     <p>Beſides, to ſpeak ingenuouſly, I believe there was another reaſon that retarded the building of this <hi>Front.</hi> If they conſider'd the Rules of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, they found that it ought to be made <hi>Gothic,</hi> as well as the reſt of the Church; but a nicer and more refin'd Judgment requir'd it to be more regularly built.

                     <p>He relates alſo, That the <hi>Po,</hi> which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is five or ſix miles diſtant from <hi>Pavia,</hi> did formerly change its courſe; and that its ancient Channel is ſtill to be ſeen about Five hundred paces from the City.

                        <note place="margin">Novi.</note> which is ſeated at the foot of the <hi>Apennine,</hi> thirty miles from <hi>Genoa,</hi> and under the Dominion of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public.

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">GENOA the <hi>Proud.</hi>
                        </note>You know the City of <hi>Genoa</hi> is ſituated at the end of a Gulph, partly on the brow of a Hill which forms a Creſcent round the Gulph,<note place="margin">From the Year <hi>1494</hi> to <hi>1528,</hi> the State of <hi>Genoa</hi> was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to above twelve kinds of Government.</note> and partly on a little Plain between the foot of the Hill and the Sea-ſhore. The Streets in the general are extreamly narrow, and the Houſes conſiſt of ſix or ſeven Stories in the lower part of the Town; but by degrees, as the aſcent ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the Houſes are lower, and built at a greater diſtance. This ſituation is certainly very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the Eye, but in other reſpects very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and inconvenient, eſpecially for <hi>Coaches,</hi> which are not much us'd here: the Ladies are carry'd in Litters, and the Men of Quality have either <hi>Chairs</hi> or <hi>Calaſhes,</hi> which they guide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="225" facs="tcp:45740:339"/>The Town is ſurrounded with a double For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, which covers it behind, and reaches on both ſides to the Shore. The neareſt and beſt of theſe Fortifications properly encompaſſes the City, and the ſecond encloſes all the riſing Grounds that command it.</p>
                     <p>My Eyes have often convinc'd me of the Falſhood of what I had formerly heard, but I never obſerv'd a wider or more remarkable difference between the Accounts I receiv'd from others, and my own Obſervation, than with reſpect to this City. 'Tis confidently reported and generally believ'd, that <hi>Genoa</hi> is built of Marble.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rubens</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd a Treatiſe of the Palaces, of <hi>Genoa.</hi>
                        </note> They who live at a diſtance from it ſcarce ever mention it without adding this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation concerning it, which is grown ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that 'tis almoſt turn'd to a Proverb. But, which is ſtill more ſurprizing, ſeveral Perſons that have ſeen it, are ſo accuſtom'd to that way of ſpeaking, that they cannot forbear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the ſame Story, either becauſe they have ſeen it without conſidering it attentively, or becauſe they chuſe rather to leave the World in an Error than to diſturb ſo pleaſant a Dream. And perhaps ſome are willing to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of this general Prejudice, which gives 'em ſo fair an opportunity to embelliſh that part of the Hiſtory of their Voyages.</p>
                     <p>But, after all, I can aſſure you 'tis abſolutely falſe, that <hi>Genoa</hi> is built of Marble; Brick and Stone, or both mix'd together, are the ordinary Materials of its Houſes, and they are almoſt all cover'd with Plaſter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="226" facs="tcp:45740:340"/>'Tis true, there are ſome Houſes in the <hi>Strada nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>va</hi> that are richly adorn'd with Marble, and even the Fronts of four or five of 'em are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wholly built of it, but theſe are all the Marble Houſes in <hi>Genoa;</hi> and I leave you to judge whether this be a ſufficient Reaſon to pretend that the <hi>whole City is built of Marble,</hi> or whether it might not be affirm'd on better grounds, That <hi>London</hi> is wholly built of <hi>Stone,</hi> or <hi>Paris</hi> of <hi>Brick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But tho' <hi>Genoa</hi> is not wholly built of Marble it may juſtly boaſt of ſome very beautiful Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; for the Houſes are extreamly large and fair in the five or ſix Streets that are of a conſiderable breadth, and in the magnificent Suburb of <hi>S. Pietro d'Arena.</hi> And beſides, Slate and Glaſs are as common here, as they are rare in moſt other parts of <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have heard ſo often of the <hi>Gardens in the Air,</hi> that are to be ſeen in this City, that I think my ſelf oblig'd to give you ſome account of 'em. If the Relations of Travellers were exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, and things were call'd by their own proper Names, thoſe who never ſaw <hi>Genoa</hi> would not form ſuch lofty Ideas of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Gardens in the Air, as if they were Machins of an <hi>Opera,</hi> or Imitations of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Gardens of <hi>Semiramis.</hi> There is ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle even Ground in this City, that, as I inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated before, they are oblig'd to make the Streets narrow, and the Houſes very high, from whence you may reaſonably conclude, that there is not much ſpare room for Gardens. To ſupply that Defect, ſeveral Perſons adorn the Balconies of their Houſes with Flower-pots,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:45740:340"/>
and ſome perhaps cover 'em with Earth, when the Buildings are all to bear the weight of it; theſe are the <hi>Gardens in the Air</hi> that make ſo great a noiſe in the World, tho' there are many other things that are not ſo much as heeded, which in this ſence may be ſaid to be <hi>in the Air.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The moſt beautiful Edifices receiv'd no hurt by the <hi>French Bombs,</hi> which were level'd direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Heart of the City, where the Houſes were thickeſt; and 'tis but too apparent they were not thrown there in vain; for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Reparations that have been made ſince, there are at preſent above Five hundred ruinous Houſes in one part of the City. And moſt of the private Sufferers in that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Calamity had the double misfortune to loſe all that they had, by loſing their Habitations; ſo that they were not only incapacitated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build 'em, but even were not able to pay the charge of removing the Rubbiſh. 'Tis plain then, that they who have a mind to ſee <hi>Genoa the Proud,</hi> muſt not look for it here.</p>
                     <p>In the Church of <hi>Our Lady of the Vineyards</hi> they ſhow'd us a Bomb which fell there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing the leaſt execution, and I believe would gladly have told us, that this was an Effect of its Reverence to ſo ſacred a place, if ſome leſs reſpectful Bombs had not thrown down four or five other Churches, and as many Convents.</p>
                     <p>During that fatal ſhowre of Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, the Doge, with thirty Perſons more, took ſhelter in the great Hoſpital call'd the <hi>Albergo,</hi> which being very high and large, not only
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:45740:341"/>
afforded a ſafe retreat to a great number of the Inhabitants, but preſerv'd a conſiderable part of their Goods, for they brought thither all that could be carried. They are at preſent working on a Third Mole, which will ſtretch further into the Sea than the other two, and (they hope) ſecure 'em againſt the danger of a ſecond Aſſault.</p>
                     <p>The Haven of <hi>Genoa</hi> is large, and of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient depth, but it lies open to the <hi>Lubeccio</hi> or <hi>African</hi> Wind, which is almoſt South Weſt, and is the moſt dangerous Wind that reigns in in this part of the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> So that they were forc'd to make a little ſecure Harbour within the Port for their Galleys, of which at preſent they have only ſix; to ſo ſmall a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber are the once formidable Navies of <hi>Genoa</hi> now reduc'd.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Pharos</hi> or Watch-Tower is very high, which here, as at <hi>Rochel,</hi> is call'd the <hi>Lanthorn Tower.</hi> To ſee the whole City diſtinctly, it muſt be view'd from three ſeveral places; from the top of this Tower, from the Sea about the diſtance of a mile, and from the top of its Hill. Theſe three different Proſpects are ſufficient to give a compleat Idea of the Town.</p>

Neither Corn nor Wine are ſold in the Markets, for the Government reſerves that Trade for its ſelf: There is not a Pint of Wine ſold by the Inn-keepers, but what is brought from the Cellar of the State; and ſince they gain nothing by the ſale of Liquors, they make the moſt of their other Commodities. The Bakers are alſo oblig'd to fetch their Corn from the public Granaries.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the moſt material Obſervations I have made during my ſhort ſtay in this City. The Canon <hi>Ferro</hi> has a Cabinet of Curioſities. I am,</p>

                     <p>IN our Journey from <hi>Genoa</hi> to <hi>Cazal</hi> we were oblig'd to return by the way we came, to <hi>Novi,</hi> where we hir'd a Coach to <hi>Turin,</hi> and the next day din'd at the little City of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Art of beſieging Towns was hardly known when <hi>Frederic Barbaroſſa</hi>'s Army lay ſix months before <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">ALEXAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DRIA.</note> without being able to take it. The Fortifications of this place are very mean.</p>
                     <p>That Emperor call'd it <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> but Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> III. would have it nam'd <hi>Alexandria.</hi> 'Tis falſe that ever any Emperors were crown'd in this City with a Crown of <hi>Straw:</hi> and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve 'tis hard to prove the Truth of another Story, which ſays, that <hi>Frederic</hi> in deriſion call'd it <hi>Alexandria of Straw.</hi> However, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that name to this very day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cazal</hi> is a well fortified City,<note place="margin">CAZAL</note> ſeated on the right Bank of the <hi>Po.</hi> The old Caſtle is not uſeleſs, but the new Citadel is a very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant place. It has ſix great Royal Baſtions, Half-Moons before the Curtains, a broad and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:45740:345"/>
deep Ditch full of Water, and an Arſenal fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with Arms for Ten thouſand Men. There were formerly ſome Irregularities in the Fortifications, but the <hi>French</hi> have put all things in order. I muſt not forget to tell you, that they have doubl'd all the Baſtions; for the old Baſtions were ſo large, that there was room enough within 'em to make a ſecond Rampart, which without the leaſt confuſion forms a new Baſtion in the middle of the former. The Town belongs ſtill to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who receives ſome inconſiderable Duties from it, and the <hi>French</hi> Garriſon keeps it for him.</p>
                     <p>Leaving <hi>Cazal,</hi> we paſs'd a fourth time over the famous<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>The</hi> Po.</note> 
                        <hi>Eridanus,</hi> and our Coach for a long time after follow'd the Banks of that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. We paſs'd by the Gate of <hi>Trin,</hi> a little fortified Town, in that part of <hi>Montferrat</hi> which belongs to the Duke of <hi>Savoy. Verrua</hi> is a much ſtronger place, on a riſing Ground, on the right ſide of the <hi>Po.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Eight miles from <hi>Cazal</hi> we enter'd into <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> the Land being ſtill level. As we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd further, we found our ſelves engag'd among the Mountains, in a large and flat Valley almoſt entirely ſurrounded with the higheſt <hi>Alps.</hi> Where this Plain is good, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be better, but there are ſome places in it that do not at all merit that Character.</p>
                     <p>Hail is the Scourge of <hi>Piedmont.</hi> As we paſs'd along we took notice of two or three large ſpots of Ground, where but two days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it had made a prodigious havock on the fineſt Corn-fields in the World. The Straw
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:45740:345"/>
was chop'd and driven into the Ground; and even the Walnut-trees, Vines, and other Trees were half broken.</p>
                     <p>They reckon but Five and forty miles from <hi>Cazal</hi> to <hi>Turin,</hi> but the miles in <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Montferrat</hi> are much larger than the common miles of <hi>Lombardy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Turin</hi> is ſituated in a Plain,<note place="margin">TURIN.</note> on the River <hi>Doire,</hi> Three hundred paces from the <hi>Po.</hi> 'Tis a very pleaſant Town, all its Avenues are chearful and delicious; and that which makes us more ſenſibly charm'd with the free and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Humour of the Inhabitants, is our Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and late Experience of that intolerable Sowreneſs and Unſociableneſs that reigns over all the reſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> where we convers'd more with Statues than Men. With reſpect to the manner of living, <hi>Turin</hi> is not inferiour to the politeſt Cities in <hi>France:</hi> the Language of that Kingdom is as commonly ſpoken here as the <hi>Italian;</hi> the People are generally well bred and handſom, and there is not a Court in <hi>Europe</hi> more ſprightly and gay than that of the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The old part of <hi>Turin</hi> cannot boaſt of much Beauty, but the new half is built after a quite different manner. The Streets are broad, and ſtreight as a Line, the Houſes large, high, and almoſt all uniform. There cannot be a finer Street than that which paſſes thro' the two open <hi>Places,</hi> and reaches from the Caſtle to the new Gate. Both theſe <hi>Places</hi> are large, and of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Figure; but the new one is encompaſs'd
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:45740:346"/>
with Houſes in exact Symmetry, and a large Portico runs all about it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">There is the old and new Palace.</note>The Duke's Palace makes not ſo fine an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance on the out-ſide as the Apartments within it are beautiful. The Palace of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,</hi> and that of the Prince of <hi>Carignan,</hi> are but juſt finiſh'd, and ſeem to be very magnificent: I name that of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> firſt, becauſe it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels the other.</p>
                     <p>Tho' this City was almoſt doubl'd under the late Duke, 'tis ſtill of a very indifferent large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: the ſame Prince enclos'd it with a regular and well-lin'd Fortification, The Citadel is very ſtrong and handſom, tho' not yet quite finiſh'd; 'tis countermin'd throughout, and has the conveniency of a good Well, where Horſes go down and come up without meeting, by a ſort of double Stairs without Steps, which wind about ſo often, that the Deſcent is very eaſie.</p>
                     <p>The Rows of Oaks on the Ramparts of the Town make a very pleaſant Walk, which has alſo the advantage of a very fine Proſpect, eſpecially towards the Rivers; but the greateſt Concourſe of People is uſually about <hi>Valentin,</hi> a Houſe of Pleaſure on the Banks of the <hi>Po,</hi> about a mile from <hi>Turin.</hi> The Duke has ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight others, all well furniſh'd, and kept in good order.</p>
                     <p>I muſt not forget to give you ſome account of the<note n="*" place="margin">Of <hi>Guarini</hi>'s Architecture.</note> Chapel that is almoſt finiſh'd at the Cathedral, to the honour of the <hi>Holy Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</hi> 'Tis certainly very magnificent; but, inſtead of telling you as ſome have done, that
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:45740:346"/>
it excels the Chapel of St. <hi>Laurence</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> I can aſſure you 'tis not at all comparable to that noble Structure. If you have not forgot the Deſcription of that <hi>Florentin</hi> Chapel in one of my former Letters, you may eaſily make the parallel between that and this of <hi>Turin:</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I have told you that they are both of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the ſame figure, but that the laſt is leſs than the former, and will be only embelliſh'd with black Marble.</p>
                     <p>The<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Reiskius</hi> has written a Diſſertation <hi>de Imaginibus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti,</hi> where you may find many curious Remarks on this Relick: He demonſtrates, that neither this nor ſeveral others were ever heard of, till Venerable <hi>Beda</hi> publiſh'd his vain Imaginations in his Treatiſe <hi>de locis Sanctis.</hi> This Reverend <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prieſt died about the middle of the Eighth Age.</note> pretended <hi>Holy Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief</hi> is the moſt important and valu'd Relic in <hi>Turin,</hi> as you may judge by the honour that is ſhown to it. Tho' this Relic ought to be the only one of its kind in the World, 'tis reproduc'd or mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply'd in five or ſix ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at the leaſt, to mention on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as I know. There are, I think, two of 'em at <hi>Rome,</hi> at St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s and St. <hi>John de Lateran,</hi> one at <hi>Cadoin</hi> in <hi>Perigort,</hi> one at <hi>Beſancon,</hi> one at <hi>Compeigne,</hi> one at <hi>Milan,</hi> and another at <hi>Aix la Chapelle.</hi> I can't imagin how the Controverſie between theſe Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors can be decided, ſince they all produce Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Bulls to confirm their Titles; but the <hi>Handkerchief</hi> of <hi>Cadoin</hi> ſeems to have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over the reſt, as being authoriz'd by four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Bulls, whereas that of <hi>Turin</hi> can only ſhew four.</p>
                     <p>Since we are juſt going to take leave of <hi>Italy,</hi> I ſhall take this occaſion to entertain you with ſome Obſervations which I either forgot or had not opportunity to inſert in my former Letters.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:45740:347"/>
Our ſhort ſtay in the places thro' which we paſs'd would not ſuffer us to ſpend much time in making acquaintance with the People of the Country, and conſequently we could not be very particularly inform'd of their Cuſtoms: neither do I intend to enter on that Subject, but only to communicate ſome Remarks to you without any other order, than as they ſhall offer themſelves to my Memory.</p>
                     <p>I ſaid nothing of the Princes or Courts either in <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe I thought it not convenient to deſcribe 'em with all that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and Freedom which I muſt neceſſarily have us'd to acquaint you with their true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. When a Prince is the Subject of a Diſcourſe, 'tis almoſt impoſſible to avoid Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Lies, and therefore I choſe rather to be ſilent, than to hazard the being guilty of either. I ſhall only tell you, that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was every where receiv'd with all the Honour and Reſpect that are due to his Perſonal Merit and High Birth; and theſe Civilities were ſometimes redoubl'd, by reaſon of the Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Friendſhip between ſome of thoſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns and his Grandfather the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and the Knowledge they had of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the late Earl of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> and ſeveral other Perſons of that illuſtrious Family.</p>
                     <p>The Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> is of great ſtature, handſom, and reſembles the Queen his Siſter conſiderably, tho' he is of a brown Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He is Maſter of ſeveral Qualifications that are able at once to inſpire both Love and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. He diſcours'd with me almoſt an hour concerning ſome particular Obſervations we had
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:45740:347"/>
made in our Travels, and eſpecially concerning <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I could not give you an account of thoſe Academies of the Curious, that are eſtabliſh'd in almoſt all the Towns of <hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe I had not time to enquire particularly about 'em; but if I may give credit to the Information I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from ſeveral Perſons, they are certainly very inconſiderable Societies. The affected oddneſs of their Titles is very ſingular, for they are not much unlike to the Names which the Grooms in <hi>France</hi> give to their manag'd Horſes; I ſhall only mention a dozen of 'em: Thus the <hi>Academiſts</hi> of <hi>Genoa</hi> call themſelves<note n="(a)" place="margin">Addormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati.</note>

                     <p>We were treated with a great deal of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Kindneſs by the <hi>Italians,</hi> as far as we could judge by outward appearances: but, to deal plainly, their Complaiſance is a mixture of Flattery and Deſign. We found alſo by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the People of this Nation are very ſober. The Inns in the little Towns, eſpecially on certain Roads, are very ill furniſh'd with
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:45740:348"/>
Proviſions. The firſt Courſe, which by way of excellence they call the <hi>Antipaſto,</hi> is a Plate of Gizerns, Ends of Wings, and Birds Feet boil'd with Salt and Pepper, and mix'd with Whites of Eggs; after which courſe, come two or three ſmall Diſhes one after another of different Ragou's. Between <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> the Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is ſometimes regal'd with <hi>Buffalo</hi>'s and <hi>Crows,</hi> and he's a happy man that can meet with ſuch Dainties: the <hi>Buffalo</hi>'s Fleſh is black, ſtinking, and hard; there are none but the moſt beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> who eat it, and the Beaſt muſt be hunted, otherwiſe 'tis impoſſible to chew its Fleſh.</p>
                     <p>They have all the various kinds of <hi>Wine</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> but the beſt ſorts are leaſt abundant: about <hi>Rome</hi> there is the Wine of <hi>Genſana, Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and <hi>Caſtel Gandolfo,</hi> in all which places the Soil is the ſame. The <hi>Greek Wine</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the <hi>Lacryma Chriſti</hi> are ſtrong, but the ſmall <hi>Aſprino bianco,</hi> and the <hi>Chiarello piccante</hi> ſeem'd more agreeable to our taſte, tho' they are much leſs eſteem'd. At <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Montefiaſcone</hi> the richeſt Wines are pleaſant, and have no more Fire than what is convenient for ordinary <hi>Drink,</hi> but there is no great quantity of 'em; the Great <hi>Duke</hi>'s delicate <hi>Moſcadello</hi> grows in a little Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and is conſecrated to his own uſe, or to be ſent as Preſents, but never diſpers'd thro' the Country: there are alſo ſome good ſorts of Wine near <hi>Verona,</hi> and in the State of <hi>Genoa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About <hi>Loretto</hi> the <hi>Casks</hi> are made ſhort and broad like a <hi>Dutch</hi> Cheeſe; but towards <hi>Pavia</hi> their length amounts to ſeven times their diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="241" facs="tcp:45740:348"/>Towards <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Placenza,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Leand. Alberti</hi> ſays, he ſaw at <hi>Parma</hi> four Cheeſes which weigh'd Five hundred pounds each.</note> where there are excellent Paſtures, they make Cheeſe of all their Milk. Butter is ſcarce in <hi>Italy,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of which they uſe Oyl in all their Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gou's and Fricaſies; but tho' they draw it from their own Olive Trees, 'tis oftentimes worſe than in thoſe Countries where none of theſe Trees grow; for the Fruit that will yield the beſt price and keep longeſt is always tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>We have not ſeen the chief Seaſon for Fruit in this Country. At <hi>Venice,</hi> where we ſtay'd two months in the Winter, we had white Grapes of <hi>Bologna</hi> very firm, and of a moſt delicious taſte. At <hi>Naples</hi> we eat Winter-Melons; and at <hi>Genoa</hi> we were entertain'd with all ſorts of ſmall red Fruits, and I never ſaw ſo good and large Cherries as there. The Country about the River of <hi>Genoa</hi> is peculiarly excellent for Fruit.</p>
                     <p>It may be truly ſaid of <hi>Genoa,</hi> that its Hills are <hi>without Wood;</hi> but all the reſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is falſe, <hi>Men without Faith, Ladies without Shame, and a Sea without Fiſhes.</hi> There are both Rogues and Honeſt men every where, and we found by Experience that there are very good Fiſhes in the Sea of <hi>Genoa.</hi> I took plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure two or three times to go in the morning to ſee the Fiſhing at <hi>Naples,</hi> where I obſerv'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of Fiſhes that I had never ſeen in other places. The Gulf of <hi>Cajeta</hi> abounds with Sturgeon, ſome of which are alſo found in the <hi>Tiber.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="242" facs="tcp:45740:349"/>In all our Travels thro' <hi>Italy</hi> we never ſaw either a <hi>Hare</hi> or <hi>Partridge</hi> in the Fields; and I might alſo add, that we ſaw as few in the Inns. 'Tis very ſtrange, in my opinion, that theſe Animals are not more plentiful, ſince the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is not wholly deſtitute of 'em. My Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are theſe: In the firſt place, there are large extents of Ground in <hi>Italy,</hi> which are almoſt uninhabited, and conſequently ought to abound with Game, proportionably to the like places in the New World. And, ſecondly, it might be reaſonably ſuppos'd that the Game ſhould be more plentiful here than in other places, becauſe the Lords of thoſe Grounds are never wont to reſide on 'em, and yet are no leſs jealous of their Rights than the Gentlemen of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> there are many Perſons of Quality who paſs their time in the Country; but that is not the Cuſtom in <hi>Italy,</hi> where all Perſons of Note live in the Cities, out of which there are neither Caſtles nor great Houſes to be ſeen, which belong to private Perſons, or at leaſt they are very rare, eſpecially if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this Country with <hi>France,</hi> for I am not ſo well acquainted with <hi>England,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To return to our Game; it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd, that <hi>Quails</hi> are not ſo great Rarities here as <hi>Partridges,</hi> for when the Spring approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches they come in Flocks from <hi>Afric,</hi> and cover the whole Country. Theſe poor little Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſo tir'd with their long Voyage, that they throw themſelves into Ships, and whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they can find a place to repoſe themſelves.

They may be caught in heaps without the leaſt trouble, but ſince they are extreamly lean, thoſe who take 'em uſually feed 'em for ſome time before they eat 'em. I believe 'tis uncertain whether theſe Birds fly over the Sea, or whether they do not ſometimes ſwim to take breath: 'tis indeed hard to conceive that the <hi>Quail</hi> which has not a ſtrong Wing, and flies heavily, ſhould be able to continue its flight ſo long. But, on the other ſide, I'm inclin'd to believe that the Water would ſo moiſten and drench its Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that it could never ſpread its Wings again. And, beſides its leanneſs and wearineſs, the Dangers to which it expoſes its ſelf, and its ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs to find a reſting place, are, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, convincing Arguments that it flies all the way without intermiſſion.</p>

There are ſeveral ways to guard againſt 'em; but I never ſaw any of thoſe hanging Beds that are uſually talk'd of. The People about <hi>Verona</hi> make uſe of Iron Bedſteads, which they place at ſome diſtance from the Walls, that thoſe Inſects may neither breed in 'em nor be able to come up on the Beds; and the Feet of the Bedſteads are fil'd and poliſh'd, partly for the ſame reaſon. If the Animal its ſelf can be caught, and bruis'd on the part which it ſtung, 'tis a certain Remedy; and there are alſo Salts and Oils extracted out of it, which produce the ſame effect. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, the ſtinging of Scorpions is not mortal in <hi>Italy;</hi> and beſides, ſuch Inſtances happen ſo

                     <p>I ſhall conclude this Letter with telling you, that we bought ſome modern Medals at <hi>Rome,</hi> from the famous <hi>Hameranus,</hi> who is reputed to excel in that ſort of Workmanſhip. Of all the Medals we ſaw of Queen <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> this, in my opinion, is one of the moſt Heroical and moſt worthy of that great Princeſs: Her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions are on the Reverſe with the whole He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere, and this Motto, <hi>Ne mi biſogna, ne mi baſta; I want nothing, and yet I have not enough. Alexander the Great</hi> could uſe the laſt part of this Motto, but inſtead of reigning over himſelf, his Ambition made him deſire more Worlds.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall only add an Inſcription, which one of my Friends tranſcrib'd juſt now from the Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal of a Statue of Juſtice in the Convent of the <hi>Jeſuits.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Veillana.</note>WE lay at <hi>Veillana</hi> the firſt night after our departure from <hi>Turin,</hi> next morning we paſs'd by the Gate of <hi>Suſa,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">SUSA.</note> a little City, ſeated among the Mountains, by which 'tis commanded almoſt on every ſide, and din'd at <hi>Novaleſa,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Novaleſa. Mount Cenis.</note> at the foot of <hi>Mount Cenis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the higheſt Mountain of the <hi>Alps,</hi> over which there is a Paſſage; but you muſt not conclude from thence that it is another <hi>Caucaſus</hi> or <hi>Tenerif;</hi> neither muſt you fancy it to be a ſingle Hill, or that the Way lies over the top of it. For when a Traveller comes to the higheſt part of the Paſſage, he finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a Plain, or a new Valley, with reſpect to the lofty Mountains that ſurround it.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Novaleſa</hi> we took Mules to aſcend the Hill. The Way is pretty broad, and free from Precipices, but uneven and full of Stones. On the higheſt acceſſible part of it there is a Croſs that divides <hi>Piedmont</hi> from <hi>Savoy,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is one of the Boundaries of <hi>Italy.</hi> In the middle of the Plain there is a Lake of ſo great a depth, that, if we may believe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Report, its Bottom could never be reach'd by ſounding; it is a large mile in compaſs, and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:45740:355"/>
ſends forth a great Brook, which falls into the little <hi>Doire</hi> near <hi>Suſa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Snow was almoſt all melted on the Hill; 'tis true, the higheſt tops of the Mountain on both ſides were cover'd with it, but there were only ſome Heaps left here and there in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. The tumbling of the Snow makes the paſſage dangerous in ſome places, and in ſome Seaſons of the Year, otherwiſe there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at all in it.</p>
                     <p>The ſide of the Hill towards <hi>Savoy</hi> is much rougher than the other, and Travellers are uſually carried this part of the way by Men, tho' they might paſs it on Horſeback, as <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemain</hi>'s Army did heretofore. They made us ſit down in ordinary Chairs, to which they had faſten'd Arms like the Shafts of a Litter. We were each of us attended by four Men, two who bore the Chair, and two more to relieve their Fellows.</p>
                     <p>At the foot of the Hill we paſs'd the little River <hi>Arche,</hi> on a Bridge of Wood, to the Village of <hi>Laſneburg.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have almoſt nothing to relate concerning <hi>Savoy.</hi> The Country is generally mountainous, and we found hardly any thing remarkable in that part of it thro' which we paſs'd.</p>

                        <hi>Aix</hi> is much frequented by reaſon of its Baths. I know not whether you have obſerv'd that the <hi>French</hi> Name of thoſe Towns that are call'd <hi>Aix</hi> is deriv'd ſometimes from <hi>Aqua,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from <hi>Auguſta: Aqua Sextiae, <hi>Aix</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>About <hi>Annecy</hi> we found the whole Country in a general Conſternation for fear of the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois;</hi> there was a Report, That above Two thouſand of theſe poor Exiles were enter'd into <hi>Savoy,</hi> towards <hi>Evian,</hi> and had already burnt five or ſix Villages: but there was not the leaſt Ground for ſuch an Alarm.</p>
                     <p>The Dutchy of <hi>Savoy</hi> is ſeparated from the Territory of <hi>Geneva</hi> by the River <hi>Arve,</hi> over which there is a Bridge of Wood that leads al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the Gates of <hi>Geneva.</hi> The <hi>Arve</hi> is a great Torrent, which falls from the Mountains, and always brings ſome Gold-duſt along with it,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:45740:356"/>
but it happens very rarely that a Man is able to refine ſo much of it in a day, as he might earn at ſome other Work; and therefore this Gold is almoſt wholly neglected.</p>
                     <p>I will not undertake to give you an account of the Antiquity, Government,<note place="margin">GENEVA.</note> or Hiſtory of <hi>Geneva,</hi> of which we have had ſo many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions. I ſhall content my ſelf with giving you a general Idea of this City, to which (ſince I had occaſion formerly to be pretty well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it) I ſhall add ſome particular Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Rhone,</hi> at its coming out of the Lake, forms a little Iſland. On the right Bank of the River, or rather toward its right Channel, the Land is low and even, but on the other ſide there is a Hillock that riſes inſenſibly. The principal part of the City is ſeated on this Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, the reſt of it is in the Iſland, and beyond the <hi>Rhone;</hi> and the whole is encompaſs'd with a Fortification.</p>
                     <p>The Republic of <hi>Geneva</hi> is in League with the <hi>Switzers,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Republic of <hi>Geneva</hi> enter'd into a perpetual League with that of <hi>Bern, An. 1536,</hi> which has been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently renew'd ſince. <hi>J. Simler.</hi>
                        </note> particularly with the Cantons of <hi>Zurich</hi> and <hi>Bern,</hi> and in this their great Strength conſiſts. Their Ramparts may preſerve 'em from a ſudden Surpriſal, and might perhaps protect 'em againſt all the Force of <hi>Savoy.</hi> But tho' theſe Fortifications are not contemptible, they could not long reſiſt a more potent Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, if the State had nothing elſe to depend on.</p>
                     <p>They have good ſtore of Cannon, and a well-furniſh'd Arſenal, where they preſerve the famous <hi>Ladders</hi> that were made uſe of by the <hi>Savoyards</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">In the year <hi>1602.</hi>

                     <p>The Republic keeps ſome Gallies on its Lake, and there are alſo others belonging to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and the <hi>Switzers.</hi> I ſay <hi>its Lake,</hi> for the Lake was given to the City by its Maſters when it was a <hi>Roman</hi> Colony, and the common way of Expreſſion at preſent ſeems to confirm that Donation.</p>
                     <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> keeps a<note n="†" place="margin">Belle-rive.</note> Fort on the Bank of the Lake, at the diſtance of a large league from <hi>Geneva,</hi> contrary to the Treaty of St. <hi>Julian,</hi> in which, among ſeveral other Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, it was concluded and ratified, That the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſhould neither draw any Forces together, nor make Fortifications, nor keep a Garriſon within four leagues of <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Opinion of ſome ancient Authors, that the <hi>Rhone</hi> paſſes thro' the Lake without min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling with its Water, is not only fabulous, but abſurd and impoſſible, conſidering the length
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:45740:357"/>
and crooked figure of the Lake. <hi>C. Frey</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">After <hi>Polybus.

                     <p>The Water of this Lake is extreamly pure and limpid; it affords ſeveral kinds of excellent Fiſhes, but its <hi>Trouts</hi> are moſt famous:<note place="margin">

                           <p>The Lake is well ſtock'd with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Fiſh, but their numbers do ſenſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and one ſort is quite loſt, it is not only to be aſcrib'd to the ravenouſneſs of the Pikes that abound in it, but to another ſort of Fiſh, that they call <hi>Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails,</hi> which were never taken in the Lake till within theſe ſix years laſt paſt; they are in the Lake of <hi>Neufchaſtel,</hi> and ſome other Lakes of <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and 'tis likely that by ſome convcyance under ground they may have come into Channels that fall into this Lake. <hi>G.

                           </p>
                        </note> I have ſeen ſeveral of 'em that weigh'd Fifty pounds each,and I know there have been ſome found bigger than theſe by a third part. Theſe Fiſhes are ſeldom found ſo big in other places; but this is not a thing without Example, as ſome imagin. In one of the Halls of the Arſenal at <hi>Munick</hi> I ſaw a Figure of a Trout that was taken out of a little Lake in that Country, and weigh'd Seventy three pounds.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps an account of the uſual way of catching Trouts at <hi>Geneva</hi> will not be unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to you. You muſt know, that at a certain time of the year that Fiſh deſcends from the Lake to the <hi>Rhone,</hi> and at other times returns back to the Lake: now, to take advantage of theſe Comings and Goings, which conſtantly happen at the uſual times, they have planted Piles croſs the River, where it comes out of the Lake, at ſuch a diſtance, that the great Fiſhes, whether aſcending or deſcending, cannot paſs thro' 'em, unleſs at certain open places which are
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:45740:358"/>
the Mouths of great Weels of Wire, where they remain till they are taken out. This Fiſhery is let out to Farmers by the State, and makes a part of its Revenue. The Piles are thus diſpos'd:</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>They kill great ſtore of Fowls on the Lake in the Winter. It was frozen in the year 1572. and ſometimes it rages like a little Sea.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Geneva</hi> is neither large nor very fine; yet it may be juſtly call'd a very lovely Town. 'Tis impoſſible for a Stranger that has ſtaid ſome time in it to leave it without reluctancy. It has the advantage of pleaſant Walks; and the Converſation of the Inhabitants is very familiar and eaſie. The common People are clowniſh, but honeſt; and the Perſons of note are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly kind, civil and ingenious.</p>
                     <p>Their Academy is furniſh'd with able Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and they have alſo ſeveral learned Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.

                     <p>At Mr. <hi>Gutſchoven</hi>'s Houſe, who is a Phyſician and great Anatomiſt, we ſaw ſeveral embalm'd Bodies, diſſected after divers methods, and very well preſerv'd, in which the Veins, Arteries, Muſcles, Nerves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſeparated and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd from each other, ſo that almoſt the entire Contexture of the Parts of a Human Body may

You know <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>'s Anſwer to <hi>Titus</hi> concerning the Impoſition on Urine. As they are great Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Flowers in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> they take particular care to preſerve this ſort of Dung to make Beds for 'em; and I fancy the odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous Smell of thoſe Flowers might furniſh matter for a Riddle, not unlike to that of <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſon</hi>'s Honey.</p>
                     <p>To change the Subject of our Diſcourſe, I can aſſure you that there are few Cities in this Country ſo well furniſh'd with good Company as <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> Almoſt all the Inhabitants ſpeak <hi>French;</hi> there is a great number of Perſons of Quality; the Ladies are handſom, and a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger may be eaſily introduc'd into the beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                     <p>Four or five great Streets of the low Town form an Iſland, and at the ſame time a kind of

Circle, where they uſually take the Air in Coaches every Evening, and even in Winter as well as in Summer; for they chuſe rather to take their Pleaſure in <hi>Coaches</hi> than to walk a foot, whereas at <hi>Paris</hi> the Tuilleries are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented than the Walks for <hi>Coaches.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I told you before, that at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in ſome other Towns of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Men never enter into the ſame Coach with Women; and the ſame cuſtom is alſo generally obſerv'd here when they go to take the Air. But whereas at <hi>Rome</hi> they are poſſeſs'd with an opinion, that Decency will not admit the Women to be ſeen in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with Men, here they ſeparate out of pure <hi>Gallantry.</hi> Perhaps you will imagin this to be a Paradox, but you muſt conſider that the Men go on one ſide and the Women on the other, and that they meet, and talk, and ogle as they pleaſe. Thus their diviſion occaſions a more general So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, which would be very diverting, if every one were not oblig'd to ſalute all that paſs by, and to repeat his Salutations as often as he meets another <hi>Coach.</hi>

                     <p>There is a pleaſant Ceremony obſerv'd by the Citizens on the 19th of <hi>January.</hi> The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men undreſs their Husbands and carry 'em to Bed, and on the morrow the Husbands treat their Friends. I cannot give you a poſitive account of the Original of this Cuſtom, but I had the fortune to be in a company where there were two different Reaſons given for it, and both the oppoſite Parties perſiſted obſtinately in their ſeveral Opinions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="289" facs="tcp:45740:372"/>Some alledg'd, that on a certain time (which they did not think fit to mention more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly) the City being reduc'd to Extremity after a long Siege, at laſt ſurrender'd on Condition, that the Women ſhould be ſuffer'd to depart unmoleſted with their little Children, and all that they could carry with 'em beſides; and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of packing up their Toilettes, every one march'd out with her <hi>Beſt-beloved</hi> between her Shoulders, and ſo cheated their Enemies.</p>
                     <p>Others, who laugh'd at this Story and call'd it a Fable, aſſur'd us, that a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Inhabitants of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> follow'd St. <hi>Lewis</hi> in his firſt <hi>Croiſado,</hi> and had the good fortune to ſuffer leſs than moſt other Troops which compos'd that numerous Army when it was totally routed: For, continu'd our Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, the greateſt part of 'em either eſcap'd or were redeem'd, and afterwards they join'd in a Body to return home. Now their Wives hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their approach, ran to meet 'em, and in a Tranſport of Joy caught 'em up, and carried 'em home in their Arms. But, if I durſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to mend the Story, inſtead of overloading the Women with ſo unreaſonable a Burden, I would content my ſelf with making 'em undreſs their Husbands the firſt night after their return, by reaſon of the good Humour of the former, and the Wearineſs of the latter.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Warriours put me in mind of a ſort of Monument that is to be ſeen over the Gate of <hi>Flanders,</hi> where there are Figures of Men arm'd with Spits. An honeſt old Man, who made me take notice of 'em, told me, that they were plac'd there for a Memorial of the Valour of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:45740:373"/>
his Countrymen, on the following occaſion. When the People of <hi>Ghent</hi> revolted under the Government of the Queen Dowager of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Charles</hi> the Fifth's Siſter, and came to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and plunder this City, the Rabble of the Town ſallied out of the above-mention'd Gate, arm'd with Spits and Pitchforks, and bravely repuls'd the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>The fineſt Churches in <hi>Bruſſels</hi> are thoſe of St. <hi>Gudula</hi> and of the <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> Theſe Fathers have great Bells, ſuch as are us'd in Pariſh Churches, contrary to the uſual Cuſtom. They made uſe of the Pretext of certain extraordinary Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zings, to obtain leave to ring a ſmall Bell; but by degrees they left off that troubleſom Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and in the mean time augmented their * Bell. This piece of boldneſs ſtirs up the Jealouſie of the other Monks, who were not over-fond of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> before.</p>
                     <p>The Chapel of the <hi>Holy Sacrament of Miracles</hi> is particularly taken notice of at St. <hi>Gudula</hi>'s, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Relicks that are kept in it. There is a Tradition, that certain <hi>Jews</hi> having bought ſeveral conſecrated Hoſts of a Prieſt, ſtab'd 'em with a Knife, and that a great deal of Blood flow'd out of the Wounds. The Jews were burnt on the higheſt Tower of the City-walls, ſo that the Fire was ſeen at the diſtance of Ten miles, and the Hoſties were found and plac'd on the Altar of the Chapel, in a Shrine of Gold. This Story is painted on the Wall near the Quire.</p>
                     <p>The Church of the <hi>Capuchins</hi> is one of the fineſt Temples that thoſe Fryars have in any part of the World.</p>

                        <hi>Mechlin</hi> is famous for its neatneſs, in which nevertheleſs, if I may judge by what appear'd to us, it exceeds not other places.

The Women of the Lordſhip of <hi>Mechlin</hi> go fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to <hi>Brabant</hi> to be brought to Bed, that their Children may enjoy the Privileges of the Natives of that Province.

'Tis ſeated on a ſmooth and level ſpot of Ground, on the right Bank of the <hi>Scheld;</hi> its Figure approaches to a Semicircle, the diameter of which is waſh'd by the River, and I'm credibly inform'd that it contains Five thouſand ſix hundred and thirty five Geometrical paces in compaſs. The Houſes are built partly of Wood, and partly of Brick, after an unuſual manner, with Battlements on the Pinacles on the tops of 'em, and very high Roofs, according to the common Faſhion of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, yet they are generally handſom. The Streets, for the moſt part, are large, ſtreight, and well pav'd.</p>
                     <p>The Fortifications are indifferent; the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts are adorn'd almoſt throughout with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Alleys border'd with great Trees, which make very pleaſant Walks; the Citadel is ſtrong, but ſomewhat neglected; 'tis a regular Pentagon.</p>
                     <p>It was built in the year 1567, and I'm told it coſt Five hundred thouſand Ducats: the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi>'s Statue in Braſs was erected in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Place of Arms; he was repreſented in compleat Armour, but without a Headpiece, his right Arm was extended toward the City, and his Hand open.

iſſu'd two Serpents. The ſix Hands held a Torch, a Leaf of Paper, a Purſe, a torn Cloak, a Club, and an Ax, and at the Feet of the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter there was a Viſor: On the Face of the Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal that look'd toward the City were theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:<note n="*" place="margin">Ferdinando Alvarez a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, Albae Duci, Phil II.

                     <p>I find a pleaſant Story in <hi>Chappuys,</hi> which I cannot forbear relating to you.

                     <p>One <hi>John Daens,</hi> a Merchant, lent a million of Gold to <hi>Charles</hi> V, (I think) toward the proſecution of the War of <hi>Hungary:</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, at his return from that Expedition, came to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and was invited to Dinner by his Creditor; he accepted the Invitation, and was ſplendidly entertain'd; and the Merchant, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had burnt a Fire of Cinnamon all the while, at laſt, to crown the Treat, threw the Emperor's Obligation into the midſt of it.</p>
                     <p>I need not tell you, that there have happen'd great Alterations ſince that time. The Port of <hi>Antwerp</hi> is deſtitute of Ships; the Exchange is deſolate and unfrequented, and the City, tho' ſtill beautiful, enjoys a ſad Tranquillity, yet there are many rich Families in it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Antwerp</hi> were the two principal Cities of the <hi>German Hanſe</hi> or League. That great Society had a<note n="*" place="margin">Tis call'd the <hi>Oſterlings</hi> Houſe.</note> large and fair public Houſe in the laſt of thoſe Cities, which is ſtill to be ſeen: the <hi>Bourſe</hi> or Exchange is Ninety Foot long, and Seventy broad, comprehending the wideneſs of the <hi>Portico's</hi> that ſurround it on the inſide. It was built in the year 1531, and took its Name from a Houſe that ſtood former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſame place, on which there was a Scutcheon charg'd with three<note n="†" place="margin">Bourſes <hi>in</hi> French.</note> 
                        <hi>Purſes,</hi> and from that time the public places appointed for the meeting of Merchants have almoſt every where retain'd the Name of <hi>Bourſe.</hi> The <hi>Town houſe</hi> is alſo a very fine Structure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="297" facs="tcp:45740:376"/>The firſt time I ſaw the Churches of <hi>Antwerp</hi> I confeſs I was ſurpriz'd with their Magnificence, and eſpecially I admir'd that which belong'd to the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> where there is nothing to be ſeen but Marble and rare Pictures; but ſince that time I have ſeen a hundred Churches in <hi>Italy</hi> which ſurpaſs thoſe of this City. Nevertheleſs that Country cannot boaſt of ſuch a Pyramid as the Steeple of the Cathedral of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> which is almoſt as<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>Thirty paces from the ſame Church there is a Well, where we obſerv'd that the Iron bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches on which the Pully hangs are adorn'd with Foliages, and were told that they were wrought by a famous Smith call'd <hi>Quintin Mathys.</hi> This Anvil-beater became enamour'd of a Painter's Daughter, and had the good Fortune to touch her Heart; he was handſom, witty, and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and beſides was Maſter of a conſiderable Fortune for a man of his Profeſſion; but the Painter would by no means be perſwaded to give his Daughter to a Black-ſmith. The old man's Obſtinacy did not diſhearten <hi>Quintin;</hi> his Love animated him, and taught him to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come that difficulty: he exchang'd his Hammer for a Pencil, and in a little time equal'd and even ſurpaſs'd the beſt Painters in <hi>Antwerp;</hi> after which he receiv'd the dear Reward of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. This generous Lover dy'd <hi>Anno</hi> 1529, and was buried at the Foot of the Cathedral,

                     <p>The Water of the <hi>Scheld</hi> being always brackiſh before <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and the Fountains of the City not ſufficient to ſerve the Brewhouſes, they were forc'd to be at the charge of bringing a new ſupply of Water by a Canal, which empties its ſelf into a great Ciſtern, out of which the Water is rais'd by Engines to a large Baſon, from whence 'tis diſtributed by forty Pipes to as many Brewhouſes. The Brewers are fix'd to that number by reaſon of the great ſcarcity of Water, which they have only at certain hours, and every one knows when to open the Cock of his Pipe.</p>
                     <p>Some Authors relate, That <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth paſſing thro' <hi>Paris,</hi> to ſhow his contempt of that City, ſaid he would put it in his<note n="*" place="margin">In French <hi>Gan</hi> ſignifies a Glove, and <hi>Ghent</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo call'd <hi>Gant.</hi> In the year <hi>1427</hi> the Count of <hi>Naſſaw</hi> Baron <hi>de Dieſtein,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Bergopzom,</hi> and the Baron of <hi>Weſemale,</hi> caus'd the Circuit of ſeveral great Cities to be meaſur'd for a Wager: and they found (as it appears by an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic Record ſtill extant) that the Circumference of <hi>Lovain</hi> exceeds that of <hi>Ghent,</hi> by three Rods or ſixty Feet. <hi>Voyage to</hi> Flanders.</note> Glove, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That it might be contain'd in <hi>Ghent.</hi> The Jeſts of great Princes are commonly receiv'd as Oracles; and this little Story, whether true or falſe, has doubtleſs occaſion'd the ridiculous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of ſeveral Authors, who ſpeak of <hi>Ghent</hi> as
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:45740:377"/>
of the greateſt City in <hi>Europe.</hi> I know not whether it might not be contain'd in the Suburb of St. <hi>Germans;</hi> but I'm ſure it will appear very inconſiderable if it be compar'd to <hi>Paris.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>Ghent</hi> is a <hi>City,</hi> but <hi>Paris</hi> is a little <hi>World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After all, it muſt be acknowledg'd, that <hi>Ghent</hi> is a very pleaſant place; 'tis a fine City, neat, prettily built, in a good Air, and convenient ſituation: whereas at <hi>Paris</hi> the <hi>Houſes hide the City;</hi> here they are not ſo thick, but that the Town may be eaſily view'd.

                     <p>It receives great Advantages from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the <hi>Scheld</hi> and <hi>Lys;</hi> there is a Bridge over the latter, on which there are two Statues of Braſs repreſenting one Man ready to cut off another's Head.

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:45740:378"/>
This rigorous Mercy inſpir'd both the unhappy Wretches with a deſire of dying, and they contended obſtinately for that which they eſteem'd the more advantageous part of ſo cruel a Choice; but at laſt the Father prevail'd, he had a greater Strength of Mind, and the length of his Life had weaken'd the deſire of it. After the Son had reſolv'd to take away the Life of him to whom he ow'd his own, and had already put himſelf in a poſture to give the fatal blow, the Sword either broke in the Air, or the Blade flew out of the Handle; which Accident being interpreted as a particular Effect of Providence, both the Malefactors were ſet at liberty.</p>

I do not intend to diſcourſe of Travels in general, but only to run over the ſeveral Steps that we made in our Voyage, and to give thoſe who ſhall follow the ſame Road, or any part of it, ſuch Inſtructions as I know to be moſt uſeful for 'em.</p>
                  <p>The Rate of Places in the Stage-Coaches and Boats in <hi>Holland</hi> is fix'd, ſo that there is no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for contending about the Price, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would be needleſs to give a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Rates, which are various, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the difference of Places and Diſtances.</p>
                  <p>The Carriage of Baggage muſt be paid apart when a Paſſenger has more than a ſingle Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantle.
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:45740:381"/>
'Tis in vain to contend with the Dutch Boat-men, and you muſt either agree on a price for the carriage of your Goods before you put 'em in the Boat, or reſolve to give 'em whatever they pleaſe to ask.</p>
                  <p>In ſome places, as at <hi>Roterdam, Delft,</hi> and the <hi>Hague,</hi> the Boats go off every half-hour; in other parts they obſerve different times of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out, but none of 'em ever ſtay a moment after the Clock ſtrikes the appointed time of their departure. Thoſe whoſe Affairs require greater haſte, may gain a day by travelling in the night; and they who embark in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the <hi>Hague,</hi> arrive next Morning at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the uſual places of changing the Boats, you always find Men with Wheelbarrows to carry your Baggage; their Rates are ſo ſmall that they deſerve not to be mention'd.</p>
                  <p>Our firſt deſign being to viſit <hi>Germany</hi> in our return, and afterwards to repaſs thro' <hi>Holland,</hi> we reſolv'd at the ſame time to ſee <hi>North Holland,</hi> but we came another way, and had not time to put that deſign in execution. While one is at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> he ought by no means to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that little Voyage, 'tis but a Walk of four days, and the Habits, extraordinary neatneſs, and other Cuſtoms of the Inhabitants of that Province, are very ſingular.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Germany</hi> you ſeldom meet with the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of regulated Paſſages; we hir'd a Coach entirely for our ſelves from <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> to <hi>Arnheim</hi> for<note n="*" place="margin">About <hi>1</hi> l. <hi>5</hi> s. and <hi>4</hi> d.</note> 
                     <hi>twelve Francs</hi> and <hi>ſixteen Sous.</hi> I will not undertake to reduce the Money to our way of reckoning, the Traveller will find what the value
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:45740:381"/>
of it is, when he comes to the places where 'tis current.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who travel alone may take notice, that the Places in the ſame Coach are of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent prices; but, as I intimated before, all the Rates are fix'd.</p>
                  <p>It coſt us nothing for the carriage of our Trunks, becauſe we were Maſters of the whole Coach, but otherwiſe we muſt have paid for 'em by weight.</p>
                  <p>We hir'd another Coach from <hi>Arnheim</hi> to <hi>Weſel</hi> for<note n="*" place="margin">Eighteen Shillings.</note> nine <hi>Francs;</hi> the Rates vary accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Seaſon of the year.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Weſel</hi> to <hi>Cologn</hi> we paid<note n="†" place="margin">Nine Shillings.</note> four <hi>Francs</hi> and a half each; for thirty <hi>Livres</hi> we might have had a Coach, which would have carried us ſtreight from <hi>Arnheim</hi> to <hi>Cologn,</hi> but we were deſirous to ſee <hi>Weſel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At <hi>Colen</hi> there are all ſorts of Paſſages to go from thence to <hi>Mentz</hi> (for I ſpeak only of our Road) but all the Land-Carriages are extreamly dear; for ſince they have no conſtant times of ſetting out, the Paſſenger muſt alſo pay for the Return, and beſides, the Ways are hilly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie: So that having no urgent Affairs to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten us, we reſolv'd, for ſeveral Reaſons, to go by Water. In the great Boats, which are drawn by Horſes, the common Rate is a crown a piece, a little over or under; and if the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers pleaſe, they may land at any Village by the way to dine or ſup. But not to retard the paſſage, which ſeems tedious enough other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to thoſe who are not furniſh'd with a good ſtock of Patience, the beſt way is, to order the proviſions for dinner to be brought in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="308" facs="tcp:45740:382"/>From <hi>Mentz</hi> 'tis but one eaſie day's paſſage on the <hi>Mein</hi> to <hi>Frankfort,</hi> by the ordinary Boat, which is large and commodious, and ſets out every day. The Rates of the places are fix'd, and the Traveller needs not deſire a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient paſſage.</p>
                  <p>We meet ſo often with different ſorts of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in <hi>Germany,</hi> that 'tis impoſſible to avoid lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by 'em. The beſt way is to make ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proviſion in <hi>Holland,</hi> of Gold Ducats, and Silver Money of the Emperor's Coin, which are current every where, without any abatement, but ſomething muſt be allow'd for the exchange of thoſe pieces. At <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> for example, you muſt give two or three pence more than the real value of a Ducat, and proportionably as much for the <hi>Piſtoles.</hi> But the Exchange of Money riſes or falls, according to the various Junctures of Trade and of the Times.</p>
                  <p>When Travellers meet together they may exchange the Money they have about 'em; but we muſt not depend on ſuch accidental Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, which happen ſeldom.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Piſtols of full weight are the beſt Pieces that can be carried to <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Bankers of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> directed us to the <hi>Neuville</hi>'s their Correſpondents at <hi>Frankfort,</hi> who are very honeſt perſons, and us'd us very kindly.</p>
                  <p>Travellers ought always to procure Letters of Recommendations for ſome Perſons of note in thoſe Towns where they intend to ſtay any conſiderable time, not only from their own Country, but alſo from the places where they ſtop on the Road; for, if any Accident ſhould
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:45740:382"/>
happen, they will be glad to know where they may find Aſſiſtance; and beſides, the Perſons to whom they are recommended may be of uſe to ſhew 'em the Rarities of the Country, to introduce 'em into Acquaintance, and to give 'em neceſſary Inſtructions. The Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Bankers are none of the leaſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.</p>
                  <p>Neither muſt a Traveller forget to take a Paſs-port from the Prince or State whoſe Subject he is: 'Tis true, theſe Paſs-ports are not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but they may be uſeful, and we were ask'd for ours in ſome parts of <hi>Italy;</hi> beſides, ſuch a Paſs, on ſome occaſions, procures Reſpect to a Stranger, and an Accident may happen which may make a man repent his neglect of this piece of Caution.</p>
                  <p>'Tis better to undergo the Loſs that is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence of Bills of Exchange, than to be troubl'd with carrying about a Load of Money. And beſides, one ought not to take more Money along with him, than will be juſt ſufficient to defray his Charge from one place to another; for there are a hundred Accidents which may make it very inconvenient for a Stranger to have his Pockets full of ſuperfluous Caſh.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a general Rule,<note place="margin">—Cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator.</note> That a Traveller ought never to make a diſcovery of his Jewels or Money, eſpecially in the Inns; for almoſt all the Robberies and Murders that are committed on Paſſengers are occaſion'd by their Imprudence in betraying themſelves.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Francfort</hi> we bought ſome Boxes of <hi>Treacle</hi> from Dr. <hi>Peters,</hi> and beſides, we had furniſh'd
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:45740:383"/>
our ſelves with ſome ſuch Proviſions at <hi>London.</hi> Health is ſo neceſſary a Companion to a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, that he cannot be too careful of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
                  <p>If we had reſolv'd to go ſtreight from <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> to <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> we might have been accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, as we were inform'd by our Friends, with the choice of two or three ſorts of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; but ſince we travell'd only to ſee the Country, we hir'd a Coach with ſix Horſes, to carry us and our Baggage whitherſoever we pleas'd, for three Crowns a day, paying the ſame rate for the return: So that if we had gone directly from <hi>Francfort,</hi> the charge of our Coach would have amounted to ſix Crowns a day; but after we had ſpent four days in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing the Country, we left the Coach at <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delberg,</hi> reckoning only two days for its return to <hi>Francfort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We were forc'd to make another bargain from <hi>Heydelberg</hi> to <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> which, in that Seaſon of the year, is ſix days Journey: We gave, as I remember, thirty Crowns for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of our Perſons and Goods, and twenty Crowns for a whole Coach from <hi>Nuremberg</hi> to <hi>Augſpurg,</hi> on condition that we ſhould take <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>golſtat</hi> and <hi>Newburg</hi> in our way. They who go by <hi>Dunavert</hi> make a whole day's Journey leſs; but we were reſolv'd to ſee <hi>Ingolſtat,</hi> which is the ſtrongeſt place in <hi>Bavaria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are Stage Coaches that go from <hi>Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpurg</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> or at leaſt to <hi>Meſtré</hi> near <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Rates of the Places are regulated, but they do not paſs by <hi>Munick,</hi> which we were deſirous to ſee for ſeveral Reaſons; and beſides,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:45740:383"/>
the Country is extreamly rough for Coaches, they are very apt to overturn, and the Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are often conſtrain'd to alight, by reaſon of the continual aſcending and deſcending among the Mountains.</p>
                  <p>And therefore we agreed to be carried on Horſeback, and our Charges born from <hi>Augſpurg</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> by the way of <hi>Munick, Inſpruck, Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſana, Trent, Verona, Vincenza,</hi> and <hi>Padua,</hi> at the rate of twenty Ducats of Gold a head. We made this Bargain by the Advice of an intereſs'd perſon, but we were inform'd afterwards that we paid too dear by a fifth or ſixth part. I thought fit to acquaint the Reader with this paſſage, not that he may imitate our Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but that he may draw ſome Advantage even from our Blunders.</p>
                  <p>We were deſirous to arrive at <hi>Venice</hi> before the <hi>Carnaval,</hi> which was not neceſſary, for 'tis ſufficient to ſee the three laſt weeks of it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for thoſe who intend not to ſpend more time in travelling than we determin'd to do.</p>
                  <p>I adviſe thoſe who may happen to be at <hi>Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpurg</hi> at the ſame ſeaſon when we were there, and deſign alſo to be at <hi>Venice</hi> during the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naval,</hi> to make a particular Bargain for <hi>Munick;</hi> and from thence to go to <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> where they may embark on the <hi>Danube</hi> for <hi>Vienna,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Venice</hi> by <hi>Saltzburg</hi> and <hi>Palma nuova;</hi> and even they may make a little excurſion from <hi>Vienna</hi> to <hi>Presburg,</hi> that they may be able to ſay they have ſeen ſome part of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and after all, come in time enough to <hi>Venice.</hi> They may afterwards take occaſion to ſee <hi>Padua, Verona,</hi> and <hi>Vincenza.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:45740:384"/>Thoſe who are of a tender Conſtitution will do well to provide good Furs at <hi>Munick,</hi> before they engage in the <hi>Alps,</hi> if they are to paſs 'em in the Winter; for beſides, that they will be in a manner overwhelm'd with Snow; the Cold is very piercing among thoſe Mountains.</p>
                  <p>When one is at <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> he ought by all means to viſit the Cabinet of Curioſities and other Rarities in the Caſtle of <hi>Amras,</hi> for which little Journey he may hire a Coach of the Inn-keepers. And that he may have time to ſatisfie his Curioſity, he ought ſo to contrive his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that he may have half a day to ſpend in this place.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Stertzlinghen,</hi> between <hi>Inſpruck</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> 'tis convenient to leave the direct Road which leads to <hi>Trent,</hi> by the Caſtle of <hi>Tirol,</hi> and to take that of <hi>Brixen.</hi> 'Tis true, the firſt way is ſhorter, but 'tis dangerous by reaſon of its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices: and for this Reaſon the Guide ought to have timely warning to take the Road of <hi>Brixen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are ſome good Inns at <hi>Venice,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Louvre,</hi> the <hi>White Lyon,</hi> and the <hi>French Arms;</hi> but when one intends to ſpend ſome months in that City, the beſt way is, to hire a furniſh'd Houſe. There are always ſome Apartments to be let in the <hi>Procuraties,</hi> which, as it is the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, is alſo the fineſt part of the Town. At the <hi>Louvre</hi> you are entertain'd for eight Livres a day, and the <hi>White Lyon</hi> and <hi>French Arms</hi> are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what cheaper, but you muſt always remember to make your Bargain for every thing before you go into the Houſe, to avoid after-Debates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="313" facs="tcp:45740:384"/>For ſeven or eight Livres a day, you may hire one of the prettieſt Gondola's with two Rowers, whom you may put into Livery, and employ in what ſervice you pleaſe. The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gondola's coſt fifteen pence an hour. Twenty pence make a <hi>Livre,</hi> and a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Piſtol contains nine and twenty Livres.</p>
                  <p>I have already ſpoken of the <hi>Ridotti</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> which are Gaming-houſes or Academies of Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, where the Noblemen cut, and Fools loſe their Money.</p>
                  <p>Here we receiv'd the firſt Letters we had from <hi>England.</hi> A Traveller ought always to acquaint his Correſpondents where he intends to ſtay for ſome time, that they may ſend their Letters thither, which for the greater Security may be directed to ſome Banker. 'Tis true, a Man may make a ſhift to live without News, but Bills of Exchange are abſolutely neceſſary in a ſtrange Country, and great care muſt be taken to prevent their miſcarrying; the ſureſt way is, to get a Letter of Credit, which is cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent every where.</p>
                  <p>Travellers are not ſtop'd on the account of Cuſtoms or Imports, either in <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and rarely in the State of <hi>Venice.</hi> The Toll-gatherers ſaw us enter into the <hi>Laguna's</hi> without ſpeaking one word to us, tho' we had a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable quantity of Baggage, but in other parts of <hi>Italy</hi> the Tolls are very frequent and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom. Nevertheleſs you may uſually buy your peace at the rate of a few<note n="*" place="margin">A Piece of Money about the value of <hi>6</hi> d.</note> 
                     <hi>Julio's;</hi> and we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver met with any of thoſe Officers ſo obſtinate as to open our Portmantles, ſave only at our arrival at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Piſa,</hi> as we came from <hi>Leghorn,</hi>
                     <pb n="314" facs="tcp:45740:385"/>
and at our departure from <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It froze, without intermiſſion all the while we ſtaid at <hi>Venice;</hi> and, generally ſpeaking, we found the Winter very ſharp all over <hi>Italy.</hi> Moſt People are perſwaded that there is hardly any Winter at all in this Country, and therefore they uſually chuſe that Seaſon to travel thither: But I can produce ſeveral Reaſons againſt the <hi>Winter,</hi> and I know no more than one againſt the <hi>Summer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Winter</hi> the Ways are uneaſie and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, eſpecially in the Mountains, by reaſon of the Snow and Ice. The Days are ſhort; a Traveller comes late to his Lodging, and is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten forc'd to prevent the Sun in the Morning; beſides, the Country looks diſmally, Nature is in a manner half dead, and neither Fruits nor Flowers are any where to be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Summer</hi> corrects all thoſe Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; 'tis hot, I confeſs, but that trouble may be eaſily avoided, by repoſing during the heat of the Day: and beſides, the coldneſs of the Winter does ſufficiently counterballance the heat of the Summer.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Venice</hi> we hir'd a Boat to <hi>Padua</hi> for Four and twenty Livres; but we might have taken places in the common Boat for two Livres a-piece.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Padua</hi> we found by chance a Coach which had brought ſome Paſſengers from <hi>Loretto,</hi> and ſtay'd for Company to return thither. We hir'd the whole Coach for Fourteen <hi>Spaniſh Piſtols,</hi> on condition that we ſhould alſo have the uſe of a Saddle-horſe, that we might ſtay
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:45740:385"/>
three days at ſuch places on the Road as we ſhould think fit to chuſe, that the Maſter of the Coach ſhould pay for our paſſage over Bridges and Rivers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and carry us by the way of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Charge of the paſſage over Rivers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not very conſiderable, but we found it very convenient to eaſe our ſelves of the trouble of it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis always worth the while to make enquiry whether there are any Coaches, or what other ſort of paſſage the Traveller intends to make uſe of, returning to the place whither he deſigns to go, for by ſo doing he may ſave Money conſiderably.</p>
                  <p>Some embark for <hi>Ancona</hi> at <hi>Rimini,</hi> and even at <hi>Venice,</hi> coaſting along the Shore of the Gulf. But when the paſſage by Land is eaſie, a curious and judicious Traveller will never chuſe to go by Sea.</p>
                  <p>In many parts of <hi>Italy</hi> you may have Stage-Horſes or Calaſhes, the Rates of which are fix'd. The greateſt conveniency of this way of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is, that you may ſtop where you pleaſe, and change your Horſes or Calaſh at every Stage, without being oblig'd to pay for their return; and beſides, you may take what time you pleaſe to ſatisfie your Curioſity.</p>
                  <p>There is conveniency for two Perſons in a Calaſh, which I prefer before Horſes for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſons; in Summer you have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Shade; they are warmer in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more commodious in all reſpects; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Paſſengers may have their Portman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles ty'd behind, tho' they ſhould amount to 200
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:45740:386"/>
weight for each Calaſh; but 'tis convenient to look to 'em from time to time, or to make a Servant follow the Calaſh on Horſeback, to take care of the Baggage.</p>
                  <p>The tying and untying of the Portmantles at every Stage is a neceſſary piece of trouble that attends this way of travelling; and therefore the beſt way for thoſe who have a long Journey to make, and intend not to ſtop on the Road, or only to make a ſhort ſtay, is, to agree with one Perſon for the whole Paſſage; and they may eaſily calculate whether the Charge will amount to more than if they ſhould change their Horſes or Calaſhes at every Stage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ferrara</hi> was the firſt place where they took our Piſtols from us; they reſtor'd 'em at the Gate by which we went out, but we were forc'd to give 'em a little Money.</p>
                  <p>When you come over againſt <hi>Catholica,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Rimini</hi> and <hi>Peſaro,</hi> it will not be improper to leave the direct way to ſee the little Town and Republic of St. <hi>Marin,</hi> which is ten or twelve miles further, on the right hand; for which Reaſon, inſtead of agreeing with one man for the whole Paſſage between <hi>Padua</hi> and <hi>Loret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> you may make your Bargain to be carried only to <hi>Rimini,</hi> where you may take Horſes for St. <hi>Marin,</hi> and return the ſame way back to <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> to continue your Journey. But if you are not ſure to find a new paſſage at <hi>Rimini</hi> for <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto,</hi> you may oblige the Perſon with whom you agree for your paſſage to carry you by the way of St. <hi>Marin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At <hi>Loretto,</hi> being eight Perſons in company, we gave twelve <hi>Italian</hi> Piſtols for three Calaſhes
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:45740:386"/>
and two Horſes, on condition that we ſhould arrive at <hi>Rome</hi> on the ſixth day. The Hurry of <hi>Loretto</hi> will not give a Traveller time to take exact meaſures for the reſt of his Journey, and therefore he muſt depend almoſt wholly on his Guide, for the choice of the Way.</p>
                  <p>You ought not to forget, when you are at <hi>Terni,</hi> to viſit the Caſcade or Waterfal <hi>del Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> which is but three miles diſtant from the Town, tho' thoſe who let Horſes thither will tell you 'tis five miles, that they may cheat you of a little Money. You muſt not give above two <hi>Julio's</hi> and a half, or three at moſt, for each Horſe, and you may ſatisfie the Man who brought you from <hi>Loretto</hi> for the half-day you make him wait at <hi>Terni,</hi> if you did not agree to the contrary at <hi>Loretto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, to avoid all this trouble, you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that little Journey in the Bargain you make at <hi>Loretto;</hi> and, I adviſe you alſo to oblige your Guide to carry you to <hi>Mount-Aeolus,</hi> near the little Town of <hi>Ceſis,</hi> eight miles from <hi>Terni.</hi> Here you may have the pleaſure of viewing a very ſingular Rarity; for the Holes and Crevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in this Mountain ſend forth perpetually, but eſpecially in Summer, certain cool Briezes, which the Inhabitants of <hi>Ceſis</hi> bring in Pipes to their Cellars and Houſes, to cool their Wines and themſelves alſo during the great Heats<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>See</hi> Kircher's Mundus Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneus.</note>; and beſides, they have this Advantage, that they may open the Pipes more or leſs, and let out what quantity of Coolneſs they pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>As you draw near to <hi>Narni,</hi> you may turn aſide to the right hand, to ſee the old Bridge
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:45740:387"/>
mention'd in one of my Letters, it will not coſt you above half an hour to ſatisfie your Curioſity.</p>
                  <p>At our firſt arrival at <hi>Rome</hi> we lodg'd in an Inn, but after our return from <hi>Naples</hi> we took a <hi>Palazzo,</hi> which in <hi>Engliſh</hi> is no more than a <hi>furniſh'd Houſe,</hi> where we were very honourably accommodated for<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>About</hi> 6 l. Sterling.</note> twenty <hi>Piaſters</hi> by the month,</p>
                  <p>When a Stranger arrives at <hi>Rome,</hi> he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately peſter'd with a multitude of Lackeys who come to offer their Service to him, but they are generally a company of treacherous Rogues, who are by no means to be truſted.</p>
                  <p>There are two things which a Traveller ought principally to obſerve, with reſpect to Servants, when he reſolves to encreaſe his Train. In the firſt place, he ought to take ſuch as are of the Country, and even of the place where he reſides at preſent, for they are acquainted with the Inhabitants and their Cuſtoms, ſpeak the Language, and are under an Obligation to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Duty better than if they were Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Secondly, he ought to receive 'em on the Recommendation of a Friend who knows 'em particularly, and can aſſure him of their Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and beſides, he may carry ſome ſpare Coats along with him, that he may put his whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the ſame Livery.</p>
                  <p>The uſual Wages for Footmen or <hi>Staffieri,</hi> as they are call'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> is two and a half or three <hi>Julio's</hi> by the day; and Servants for the Kitchin may be hir'd at the ſame rate.</p>
                  <p>We gave fourteen Piſtols by the month for a handſom Coach with two good Horſes, tho' in another Seaſon we might have had one for
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:45740:387"/>
twelve, and even ſometimes for ten; but the greateſt concourſe of Strangers at <hi>Rome</hi> is in the time of <hi>Lent,</hi> and at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> which enhances the price of many Conveniencies.</p>
                  <p>They who are at <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Lent</hi> may eaſily obtain a permiſſion to eat Fleſh; and even the Inn-keepers on the Roads will accommodate you with it, but you muſt not ask it too openly, leſt you expoſe 'em to Cenſure. I have ſeen ſome Paſſengers quickly ſatisfie the Scruples of their Landlords, by threatening to go to another Lodging. But generally the <hi>lean</hi> days deſerve that name with a witneſs almoſt every where in <hi>Italy,</hi> and 'tis hardly poſſible for a Stranger to accuſtom himſelf to thoſe Severities.</p>
                  <p>A Traveller who intends not to ſtay above two or three months at <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after his arrival agree with a skilful Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and fix certain times to viſit with him the principal Rarities of that famous City; for tho' ſeveral Authors have attempted to deſcribe 'em, a curious and inquiſitive Perſon, who examines things upon the ſpot, and with his own Eyes, will always be able to make ſome new Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and therefore, without conſulting Books, unleſs as Helps and Guides, he ought to take a particular view of every thing that is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſet down all that he ſees in his Journal; for it happens not unfrequently, that a Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler finds a very conſiderable difference between his own Obſervations and the Deſcriptions of others, when he compares 'em together. And to make his Induſtry the more ſucceſsful, he ought always to carry a Note book about him, and every Evening to examin and tranſcribe the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:45740:388"/>
Obſervations of the Day; nor will it be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to uſe this method every where elſe, as well as at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To eaſe my Memory, and that I might be able on all occaſions to gratifie my Curioſity by an exact enquiry into what was moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in every City and Country thro' which we paſs'd, I drew up the following Catalogue, which always furniſh'd me with a ſufficient number of uſeful Queſtions.</p>

                     <pb n="321" facs="tcp:45740:388"/>D. <hi>Pietro Roſini</hi> was our Antiquary at <hi>Rome;</hi> he is well acquainted with Medals, and trades in 'em. I think we gave him three Piſtols a month.</p>
                  <p>'Tis convenient for a Traveller to view the Curioſities of <hi>Rome</hi> in the company of other Strangers; for ſo his Pleaſure is encreas'd by the converſe of his Companions, and many Eyes ſee better than one.</p>
                  <p>No man ought to undertake a Voyage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making Proviſion of ſeveral ſorts of Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, Geographical Charts, a Watch, Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive-Glaſſes, a Mariner's Compaſs, and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant. And as far as he is able he ought to take the dimenſions of every thing; in order to which he may eaſily carry along with him a Cane divided into ſeveral Meaſures. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I took care to furniſh my ſelf with a piece of Packthread well twin'd and wax'd, fifty fathom long, and divided into feet by Knots, by the help of which I could in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment meaſure long Diſtances, the heighth of Towers, bigneſs of Pillars, and what elſe I thought fit to obſerve.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Roman Palm,</hi> or Span and a half, make juſt thirteen Inches <hi>Engliſh</hi> meaſure; the <hi>Roman</hi> Foot is ſhorter by ſix lines than that of <hi>England.</hi> Eight <hi>Roman Feet</hi> make a <hi>Roman Canne;</hi> and a<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Braſſe</hi> or Fathom of <hi>Florence</hi> is equal to two <hi>Roman</hi> Feet.</p>
                  <p>A Traveller finds ſo much Pleaſure in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting the Maps of the Countries thro' which he paſſes, that he can hardly forbear wiſhing he had compleat Setts of all that are extant; there are three things which ought to be obſerv'd on
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:45740:389"/>
this occaſion by thoſe who deſign to travel; firſt, they ought not to content themſelves with reſolving to buy Maps in the Countries whither they intend to go, but make ſufficient proviſion of 'em before their departure, and even take ſome of all Authors, for we enquir'd for 'em in vain in ſeveral great Cities; and it happens not unfrequently that the leaſt eſteem'd are upon tryal found to be the moſt exact. Secondly, their Maps ought to be paſted on Linnen or Canvas, and roll'd up on Sticks. And in the laſt place, every judicious and curious Traveller ought to note down all the Errors he perceives in 'em, and communicate his Obſervations to thoſe who make 'em; for, if every ingenious Perſon would endeavour to promote ſo uſeful a Deſign, in a little time we ſhould have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain of the Uncorrectneſs of Maps.</p>
                  <p>The Proſpective-Glaſſes ought to be of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts, and adapted both to great and ſmall Diſtances; they are uſeful for thoſe who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to take a diſtinct view of Inſcriptions, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, Statues, Ornaments of Architecture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To return to <hi>Rome;</hi> the Curious may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh themſelves with Prints of all its Antiquities, and other remarkable things that are to be ſeen in and about the City, of almoſt all which they may have compleat Setts for a hundred Piſtols.</p>
                  <p>Not only in that City, but every where elſe, 'tis convenient for a Traveller to make a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of ſuch Prints, which will be of uſe to refreſh and rectifie his Ideas of the places he has ſeen; and they who are moſt curious may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a skilful Deſigner along with 'em.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:45740:389"/>I thought to have ſubjoin'd a Catalogue of about Three hundred of the fineſt Pictures we ſaw at <hi>Rome,</hi> but I'm inform'd there is an entire Collection of all thoſe Pieces already communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Public.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Calaſhes are very pretty, and fit for taking the Air in a level Country, but not at all convenient for travelling; in the mean time, ſince ſeveral perſons are very fond of 'em, I adviſe thoſe who deſign to make uſe of 'em for a Journey, to take care that they be bound more ſecurely with Iron than uſually they are; to chuſe ſuch as are cover'd with Wax'd Cloth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than with Leather, which grows hard, cracks, and is too heavy; and to place the Body of the Calaſh immediately upon the Shafts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of hanging it, for ſo it will be leſs apt to overturn.</p>
                  <p>But the beſt way is, not to meddle with theſe Calaſhes, which occaſion ſo much trouble to thoſe who uſe 'em; for they muſt buy Horſes, and hire new Servants, both which are ſubject to a thouſand Accidents, and ſo many different Cares ſpoil the pleaſure of Travelling. And even ſometimes the Grooms prick the Horſes Feet in ſhoeing 'em, when Gentlemen travel on their own Horſes, to oblige 'em either to buy others, or ſtay till their own are recover'd.</p>
                  <p>After all, Money makes every thing eaſie, and there is no difficulty ſo great that may not be ea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſily ſurmounted by thoſe whoſe Pockets are well lin'd with Gold.</p>
                  <p>They who happen to be at <hi>Rome</hi> at the time of the arrival of the <hi>Quails,</hi> will do well to leave the City for two or three days, and take a

Journey towards <hi>Oſtia</hi> or <hi>Prattica</hi> on the Sea-coaſt.</p>
                  <p>The Journey from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Naples</hi> is uſually perform'd thus: The Travellers hire either Horſes or Calaſhes, or both together, that they may have the advantage of eaſing themſelves by change. And the Perſon with whom they agree at <hi>Rome,</hi> every Paſſenger paying <hi>Fifteen Piaſters,</hi> obliges himſelf to give 'em eight Meals in their Journey outwards, and as many in their return, to ſtay five whole days at <hi>Naples,</hi> to pay the Boat at <hi>Cajeta,</hi> to lend his Horſes one day to <hi>Veſuvius,</hi> and another to <hi>Puzzolo,</hi> both which are comprehended in the five to be ſpent at <hi>Naples.</hi> Thus the whole Journey is perform'd in fifteen days, on the laſt of which they return to <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This way of Travelling is not altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient for thoſe who are oblig'd to make haſte, but they who are Maſters of their own time ought to take other meaſures; for a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Perſon may find Employment enough at <hi>Naples</hi> for twelve or fifteen days at leaſt, and 'tis almoſt impoſſible in the narrow ſpace of one day to take a view of all the Antiquities and other Rarities that are to be ſeen about <hi>Puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zolo,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore they who have leiſure to ſatisfie their Curioſity, may make uſe of the <hi>Procaccio</hi> or ordinary Poſt from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> where they may ſtay as long as they pleaſe, and return by the ſame way. I could not hear of any Stage-Paſſages, or ſuch as may be chang'd from time to time, in this part of the Country.</p>
                  <p>They who chuſe the firſt method of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Journey are forc'd to return by the ſame
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:45740:390"/>
way they came, which cannot but be extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unpleaſant to an inquiſitive Traveller; but when one is at <hi>Naples,</hi> without any Obligation to make uſe of a particular kind of Paſſage, he may in his return leave the direct Road, and travel further within the Land on the right ſide of it, hiring Horſes from Town to Town. I know ſome Perſons who took this way, but 'tis not frequented, and therefore I only give this Advice to thoſe who are willing to purchaſe the Satisfaction of their Curioſity, and the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Novelty, at the expence of a little Trouble.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Naples</hi> we lodg'd at the <hi>Golden Dove,</hi> where we pay'd ten <hi>Carlins</hi> each. The <hi>Dove</hi> and <hi>Three Kings</hi> are the only good Inns in this City. Our Coach coſt us no more than twelve <hi>Carlins</hi> a day. At <hi>Rome</hi> you pay but ſeven <hi>Julio's</hi> in the beſt Inns, and if you make a Bargain for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time, they will content themſelves with ſix.</p>
                  <p>They trade much here in Silk Stockins, Veſts, and other Worſted Clothes, which are not comparable to thoſe that are made at <hi>London.</hi> The Merchants of this place over-rate their Commodities extreamly.</p>
                  <p>I never heard that there was any Catalogue made of the chief Pictures that are to be ſeen at <hi>Naples;</hi> and therefore, beſides thoſe mention'd in my Letters, I ſhall name ſome others for the conveniency of young Painters, who travel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy.</hi> I ſpeak only of ſuch as are in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Convents, or other places, where a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller may be eaſily admitted to take a view of 'em.</p>

the Poſtilions knew well enough before they ſet out, that they could not paſs further, for this is one of their ordinary Tricks. They ſeem to be ſurpriz'd when the Waters ſtop 'em, and, when they can, make the Paſſengers pay the full price that was agreed on for the whole Journey, under pretext that they cannot be juſtly blam'd for ſuch an unforeſeen Accident. 'Tis true, we might have oblig'd our Calaſhes to take a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs and carry us to <hi>Milan,</hi> but then we our ſelves muſt have had the deepeſt ſhare in the trouble; and therefore we choſe rather to embark on the Canal at <hi>Canonica,</hi> and divide the loſs with the Poſtilions.</p>

                  <p>You muſt paſs the Mountains between <hi>Novi</hi> and <hi>Genoa</hi> on Horſeback; the Rates vary accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Seaſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="333" facs="tcp:45740:394"/>We gather'd a great deal of Baggage during our Voyage, and the number of our Trunks was encreas'd by one half; but to rid our ſelves of that Encumbrance, we embark'd the greateſt part of 'em at <hi>Genoa.</hi> They who buy a great number of Curioſities will do well to follow our Example: they will find at all the Sea-ports Conſuls of their own Nations, who will help 'em to make a ſure Bargain with the Maſters of Ships, and give 'em all manner of aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>At our return from <hi>Genoa</hi> to <hi>Novi</hi> we hir'd a Coach with four Horſes for <hi>Turin,</hi> to go by the way of <hi>Caſal.</hi> At <hi>Turin</hi> we took Horſes for <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> where we hir'd others for <hi>Baſil,</hi> and from thence took freſh Horſes for <hi>Strasburg,</hi> agreeing to paſs by <hi>Hunninghen, Friburg, Briſack,</hi> and <hi>Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtat.</hi> 'Tis to be obſerv'd that a Traveller ſaves himſelf a great deal of trouble, by making it a part of his Bargain, that his Charge ſhall be defray'd on the Road. 'Twould be needleſs to mention what our paſſage thro' theſe places coſt us, ſince the Rates vary perpetually; the length or ſhortneſs of the Days, eaſineſs or badneſs of the Roads, and greater or leſs concourſe of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers occaſion theſe variations.</p>
                  <p>While you are at <hi>Geneva,</hi> you may hire Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to ſee the fall of the <hi>Rhone,</hi> and at the ſame time take a view of the Fort <hi>l'Ecluſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>Strasburg</hi> we embark'd on the <hi>Rhine</hi> to <hi>Cologn,</hi> the charge of the paſſage is inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. There are ſome large and well-cover'd Boats, which a Traveller ought to chuſe rather than thoſe little Wherries, that conſiſt only of four or five Boards nail'd together. You may embark on the <hi>Rhine</hi> at <hi>Baſil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="334" facs="tcp:45740:395"/>We hir'd a whole Coach from <hi>Cologn</hi> to <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</hi> where we took another for <hi>Ghent,</hi> and from thence continu'd our Journey to <hi>Oſtend</hi> by ſeveral Canals; the price of places in the Boats is fix'd, and at <hi>Oſtend</hi> we hir'd a Coach, that we might arrive the ſooner at <hi>Newport,</hi> tho' there is alſo a Canal between theſe two Cities.</p>
                  <p>The Boat that paſſes between <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and <hi>Villebroeck</hi> is extreamly commodious: The Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers may be accommodated with Meat and Drink; and in the beſt Chamber, call'd the <hi>Roufle,</hi> there is a Chimney, and a little compleat Set of Furniture: You muſt pay ſomewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary to be in this Chamber.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the things which I either deſcrib'd or mention'd in the account of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers may viſit the Abby of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Refectory, and the Pictures in the Abbot's Apartment, the Churches of the <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> St. <hi>James,</hi> and the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines of Tapeſtry.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Antwerp</hi> you may be well accommodated at <hi>Laboreur</hi>'s; and in <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> at Sieur <hi>Drouïn</hi>'s at the Sign of the Golden Fountain.</p>
                  <p>They who have not the conveniency of a <hi>Yacht</hi> for their paſſage to <hi>England,</hi> need not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to go by the <hi>Pacquet-boat,</hi> which, tho' not ſo honourable, is both as ſafe and as good a Sailer as the other.</p>
                  <p>D. <hi>Antonio de Guevara</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mondonedo,</hi> and Preacher to <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, relates, That the application of a Bag of <hi>Saffron</hi> to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Heart, is an effectua l Remedy againſt the Sickneſs and Vomiting with which
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:45740:395"/>
thoſe that are not<note n="*" place="margin">I'm inform'd by ſome Perſons that they have receiv'd great Benefit on ſuch occaſions, by applying a Bag ſtuff'd with grey <hi>Salt</hi> heaten ſmall, to the Stomack. And others aſſure me, That the beſt Remedy is, to keep always, night and day, a piece of <hi>Earth</hi> under the Noſe; for which purpoſe they provide a ſufficient quantity of Earth, and preſerve it freſh in a Pot of Clay; and when they have us'd a piece ſo long till it begins to grow dry, they put it in again into the Pot, and take out ſome freſh Earth.</note> accuſtom'd to the Sea are uſually troubl'd. And he adds, That he try'd the Experiment with very good ſucceſs, when he follow'd his Maſter to <hi>Afric,</hi> in his Expedition againſt <hi>Tunis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis almoſt impoſſible to give Directions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Road that ought to be taken by thoſe who deſign to travel to <hi>Italy,</hi> ſince the choice of that depends on the place where they intend to enter the Country, and the time they reſolve to ſpend in it. Only, in the general, they ought to conſult the Map, and ſo to take their Meaſures, that they may ſee the laſt days of the <hi>Carnaval</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> the <hi>Holy Week</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Octave</hi> of the Sacrament at <hi>Bologna;</hi> to avoid being at <hi>Rome</hi> during the great Heats; to traverſe the Country, to ſee as much of it as they can; and to endeavour not to paſs twice by the ſame way. If they cannot be at <hi>Venice</hi> during the <hi>Carnaval,</hi> they ought at leaſt to be there on <hi>Aſcenſion-day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may perhaps be convenient for two or three Strangers to travel in company together; their Fellowſhip ſometimes makes 'em paſs their hours more cheerfully, and employ the time they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow in making Obſervations with better Succeſs and greater Pleaſure, eſpecially when they are all Men of Probity, and of one Humour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:45740:396"/>But theſe Societies are obnoxious to the ſame Inconveniencies with which Marriage is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for when their Humors do not agree, it had been better for 'em they had never come together. Some are curious, deſirous to ſee and examin every thing with care, and never ſcruple to expoſe themſelves to a ſhower of Rain, or to find their Dinner cold at the Inn, if they can but make ſome new Diſcovery or important Obſervation: whereas there are others who tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel like Poſt-horſes, and neither mind Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons nor Libraries, provided they can find a good Bed at night, and good Victuals when they are hungry. And therefore a prudent Perſon ought never to enter into a Society, till he has firſt throughly ſtudied the Humors of his intended Companions.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, 'tis by no means convenient to travel in Companies in <hi>Italy;</hi> the Inns are ſo miſerable that oftentimes they can neither accommodate their Gueſts with Meat nor Beds, when they are too numerous.</p>
                  <p>A Stranger ought always to be furniſh'd with ſome Iron Machin, to ſhut his Door on the inſide, which may be eaſily contriv'd, and made of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts; for it happens not unfrequently, that the Doors of the Lodging-rooms have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lock nor Bolt; and 'tis commonly obſerv'd, that <hi>Opportunity makes a Thief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Curioſity of a Traveller, eſpecially of a young man, who goes to ſee the World that he may learn to live in it, ſhould not be confin'd barely to Enquiries after inanimate Curioſities. They whoſe Quality can procure 'em admittance in the Courts of Princes, ought never to paſs
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:45740:396"/>
by ſuch places without viſiting 'em. They ought alſo to ſee good Company, to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe Perſons that are famous for their Skill in Arts and Sciences, and to diſcourſe with 'em, for 'tis impoſſible to receive certain Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any thing, but from Perſons of that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and their Converſe is in all reſpects uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>To prevent the Inconveniencies of a bad Lodging, they who do not carry a compleat Bed about with 'em ought at leaſt to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of Bed-cloaths and Coverlets. I do not propoſe this piece of Caution to comply with the over-niceneſs of ſome Perſons, but to guard againſt the ill conſequences of an incommodious Bed, that may be very prejudicial to Health, which is ſo neceſſary a Bleſſing, that if it were only for the preſervation of that, a Traveller ought to avoid all manner of Exceſs.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, if we call to mind that a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller is more obnoxious than other Perſons to Accidents that may diſturb the Repoſe of his Life, this Reflexion ought to be a new and powerful Motive to engage him not to forget the principal Duties of it.</p>
